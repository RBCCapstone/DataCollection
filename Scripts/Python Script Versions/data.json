The escalators bright red and blue hues and a large LED ceiling (that creates the illusion of a blue sky) pop in sharp contrast with the grey curtains used to cordon off a dusty construction area. Change is afoot on the ground floor of one Manhattans most iconic department stores.</p> <p>The sense of theatre epitomizes what Metrick, who has been president of the HBC-owned Saks since 2015, is convinced the company has to offer todays shoppers, particularly at its 650,000 square-foot New York City flagship.</p> <p>The buzz of activity comes at a time when Saks has some wind in its sails again after faring a rough patch three years ago. Sales were declining quarter after quarter. It was losing market share and the Grande Dame of New York luxury, a fixture since 1924, had lost much of what made it stand out.</p> <p>Now, Saks has reported seven quarters of comparable sales gains in the last eight, including a 7.3% jump in the third quarter. And, to Metricks big satisfaction, that recent performance bested those of two major rivalsNordstrom and Neiman Marcusover the same period. But those competitors are not idling: both Neiman and Nordstrom are adding their first namesake department stores in New York this year.</p> <p>The luxury market might be crowded but it is booming: according to Bain & Co, the U.S. personal luxury goods market rose 5% to $85 billion in the United States. Whats more, Spectrem Group estimates there are now 10 million Americans with a net worth between $1 million and $5 million, up 67% from a decade ago. </p> <p>A run of the mill store just wont do, both in terms of the physical location but also how tech is integrated into them. Ergo a $250 million invested in the multi-year remodel of the flagship of a 41-store chain.</p> <p>While the renovation doesnt feature anything outlandish like the indoor ski hill Saks installed in the 1930s (try getting a CFO to sign-off on that today) its still trying to channel that spirit as it looks to make the Fifth Avenue store a modern-day destination.</p> <p>Last year, the beauty section moved up a floor but not without getting 40% more space and new amenities like facial workouts and offering anti-cellulite treatments and. The area, historically on street level to generate shopper visits, offers clean sightlines with more natural light from outside, a feature all floors will have by 2021. (The next project is mens shoes, now spread out over three floors, but soon to be concentrated in one lavish area.)</p> <p>Shopping isnt the only component of Metricks vision for Saks as a New York destination: the evening of a recent press preview, Saks had its first VIP dinner at LAvenue, a new high-end Philippe Starck-designed restaurant on the 9th floor. Its the only outpost of the Paris eatery that attracts A-list names like Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9.</p> <p>While Saks is thriving now, it was a different story just a few years ago. HBC, a department store conglomerate that also includes its namesake Canadian chain and Lord & Taylor, bought Saks for $2.4 billion in 2013. </p> <p>There had been turmoil in the c-suite, strategy lurches, and the prevailing opinion that Saks was an icon adrift. So when Metrick, now a 23-year veteran of the brand, took the reins in 2015, he immediately began with a deep dive into customer perceptions. Among the humbling results: Saks and its archrival Neiman Marcus were interchangeable in shoppers eyes.</p> <p>After years of trying to be all things to all people, Saks didnt stand for anything, Metrick recalls. </p> <p>And thats no small order, what with some 85% of any luxury department stores offerings overlapping with rivals. Its also not getting easier at a time brands themselves are opening more of their own stores and taking more control of how their wares are presented.</p> <p>The high-end department stores added to their own problems in the last decade by getting more promotional, says Bain & Co partner Vandana Radhakrishnan. That led many brands, from Coach and Ralph Lauren on up to focus more on their own stores.</p> <p>But luxury brands, particularly smaller ones, can only do so much with their own sites and stores in reaching a wide audience. So great, well-trafficked stores and strong e-commerce are remedies for that problem. Notably, Metrick says he can give detailed customer data to luxury brands, including what other brands they like.</p> <p>Thats why Metrick sees reinventing the flagship as so important, with many ideas being adapted to the 40 other stores in the fleet.</p> <p>Metrick says thats already paying off: online return rates are typically 40% to 50%, a cost that pinches margins. That drops to 20% for sales clinched via the Salesfloor service.</p> <p>Every year, some 30 million people visit a Saks store, while Saks.com gets 150 million visits. At stores, 20% of visits yield a sale, while online the rate is more like 2.5%. And so while not as flashy as a designer escalator, ecommerce is crucial for maintaining momentum.</p> <p>Shes thinking about every other online experience out shes having today and is Saks as easy as all that, says HBC CEO Helena Foulkes of the prototypical Saks shopper.</p> <p>Saks was recently reminded of how hard it is to win over the modern shopper, even on its home turf. In January, it closed a womens store in Lower Manhattan after only two years. </p> <p>But Foulkes, previously president of CVS pharmacys $80 billion retail business, won kudos from analysts for dropping an underperforming location and zeroing in on where Saks can win. The next dollar I invest has to be in the place with the most upside, she says. </p> <p>To enable that, Foulkes has been busy in her first year on the job making big moves to undo much of HBCs aggressive expansion in the last half decade, one that led it to go around chasing stars, as Scotiabank retail and consumer analyst Patricia Baker puts it.</p> <p>That has included paying down HBCs sizeable debt by selling off half of its struggling European business, its Lord & Taylor flagship 10 blocks south of Saks, and Gilt Groupe; moves that won it recent upgrades from debt agencies. HBC also recently announced the closure of 20 Off Fifth discount stores and halted its Canadian expansion of Saks, which had called for seven stores, opting instead to cap it at three. </p> <p>Thats not to say HBC is only in contraction modethe company is planning a new Saks store at the American Dream mega-mall being built in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p> <p>But it does signal that HBC is doubling down on best performing businessSaksparticularly the flagship. Though HBC doesnt break out individual stores numbers, the Manhattan flagship generates at least $600 million a year, or 15% of so of Saks total sales.</p> <p>The Saks brand is only going to be as strong as that Fifth Avenue store, says Scotiabanks Baker. And Saks doesnt want its so-called branches to be seen as backwaters. So edgy brands like V\u00eatements and Jacquemus are now sold at other stores too, not just Manhattan.</p> <p>Other ideas have also made their way to its branches in other markets. Take The Collective, an area that focuses up and coming brands, including to solidify what Metrick calls Saks fashion authority.</p> <p>Our role in the fashion ecosystem is to be the place to introduce brands to our consumer, he says. </p> <p>A more subtle part of Saks store remodel has been to mix up price points and brands rather than consign all ultra high end designer items in the same areas, as they were before. On the fifth floor for instance, more accessible brands like Acne and Alexander Wang are next to designers like Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Simone Rocha.</p> <p>Under Metrick and Foulkes, Saks has a much faster metabolism now. Fail fast and move on. And that, he says, is merely a reflection of how customer behavior has evolved. The luxury consumer is certainly less forgiving and less patient that they used to be, Metrick says.</p>", "url": "http://fortune.com/longform/saks-fifth-avenue-flagship-renovation/", "tags": ["own stores", "next designers", "only outpost", "customer perceptions", "other stores"], "related_articles": [{"title": "ITV sees ad spending extend its decline into first quarter", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b8c278ec-3a63-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0"}, {"title": "Target is inviting retailers to its website as it tries to catch up with Walmart and Amazon online", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/24/target-is-inviting-other-retailers-to-join-its-website.html"}, {"title": "Gap shares surge 25 percent as Wall Street praises split", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gap-stocks-idUSKCN1QI4NY"}]}, {"title": "L Brands plans to close roughly 53 Victoria's Secret stores this year, after mixed holiday results", "source": "cnbc", "date": "2019-02-28T12:45:00Z", "origContent": "<p>L Brands plans to close roughly 53 Victoria's Secret stores in 2019, as the lingerie retailer continues to lose steam against newer rivals.</p> <p>L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, on Wednesday reported mixed results in the holiday quarter that sent shares of the company down more than 5 percent.

The merger that he engineered between Heinz and Kraft in 2015 has turned out very badly: Heinz paid too much for an indigestible bunch of ageing brands in the wrong country.</p> <p>The $15.4bn impairment of Kraft Heinz assets that contributed to a plunge in its share price on Friday can be put down to various causes \u2014 cost-cutting by 3G, the private equity group that manages it, discounting by supermarkets, and changing tastes among millennials. But there is a simpler explanation: 98 per cent of Kraft\u2019s sales before the merger were in North America.</p> <p>It would be anathema to Mr Buffett to admit it. Not only has he always been a staunch believer in US enterprise and \u201cour country\u2019s almost unbelievable prosperity\u201d, but he embodies 20th-century consumerism. His habitual drink is Cherry Coke (Berkshire holds a 9.4 per cent stake in Coca-Cola) and he picks up breakfast each day at a McDonald\u2019s in Omaha, Nebraska.</p> <p>Were he less parochial, he might have seen Kraft Heinz\u2019s downfall coming. He noted on Monday how sales of the Kirkland Signature private label brand owned by Costco, the US discount warehouse club, had overtaken all of the Kraft Heinz brands put together. The old trick \u2014 advertising brands heavily and pushing them on to supermarket shelves \u2014 was failing.</p> <p>In other words, what he calls the \u201cmoat\u201d around US packaged food brands has been crossed. As he wrote in his 2007 annual letter, he has always avoided investing in \u201ccompanies in industries prone to rapid and continuous change\u201d in favour of those with \u201csuperiorities\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that make life difficult for their competitors\u201d. These were either low-cost providers or companies with \u201ca powerful worldwide brand\u201d.</p> <p>The consumer moat was first crossed in Europe, where supermarkets have cultivated their own brands for longer, and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl have shown that consumers will avoid paying a premium for staples. Kirkland Signature\u2019s annual sales of $39bn are old news in Europe, with private labels holding more than 40 per cent of the market in the UK and Germany.</p> <p>When Kraft\u2019s snack brands such as Cadbury and Oreo were demerged into Mondelez International in 2012, Kraft was left with history. The theory was that Heinz could push Kraft\u2019s brands overseas, but there is little hunger for American concoctions such as Cheez Whiz, nor thirst for Kool-Aid, the brand of flavoured soda powders invented in Mr Buffett\u2019s home state in 1927.</p> <p>This was compounded by the cost-cutting zeal of 3G, Mr Buffett\u2019s unlikely partner at Kraft Heinz. Mr Buffett this week defended its mantra of raising margins rather than investing in growth, saying that innovation and marketing were unaffected by zero-based budgeting. But there was collateral damage \u2014 3G has admitted as much by putting $300m into innovation.</p> <p>Decades of pursuing convenience and reliability, rather than health and organic ingredients, leave Kraft Heinz with a credibility gap when it turns to wooing the new generation. Its announcement in January that \u201cKraft Natural Cheese is now made with milk from cows raised without the artificial growth hormone rbST\u201d invites the question of what \u201cnatural\u201d meant before.</p> <p>But every brand starts small \u2014 Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream was founded in 1978 before outgrowing its craft roots and being acquired by Unilever in 2000. The most troubling development for Mr Buffett is that retailers have adapted to consumers better than Kraft Heinz. The Simple Truth organic brand created by the US supermarket chain Kroger passed $2bn in annual sales in 2017.</p> <p>This has daunting implications for his attachment to US food and drink brands. Low cost retailers such as Costco and Walmart still have moats similar to the one around Geico, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s retail insurer. They can sell their own staples, competing with Kraft Heinz and others, and cutting the price premium they enjoyed.</p> <p>It also shows that his fondness for the US reached a limit with the Kraft Heinz deal. The notion that Kraft\u2019s quaint products could be given the 3G treatment yet manage to grow relied on the country remaining a retail world unto itself. It turns out to have more in common with Europe than he realised: advertising flavoured with history is no longer enough.</p>", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9528a408-39b2-11e9-b856-5404d3811663", "tags": ["quaint products", "indigestible bunch", "cadbury", "old europe", "artificial growth hormone"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Warren Buffett explains how Costco is dominating in one crucial area (COST)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-costco-kirkland-brand-thrives-2019-2"}, {"title": "The Latest: Buffett says tariffs have hit Berkshire Hathaway", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/6185c0ef8dc24e27bfd81553f8e54a14"}, {"title": "Kraft Heinz and its investors taste the food industry\u2019s woes", "source": "the-economist", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/03/02/kraft-heinz-and-its-investors-taste-the-food-industrys-woes"}]}, {"title": "Short sellers get set for more pain in US retail", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-02-27T04:00:25Z", "origContent": "<p>Short sellers who made big bets against US retailers a couple of years ago had hoped for carnage across the board.

It hasn\u2019t been decidedly one way down.\u201d</p> <p>Fears that the relentless growth of Amazon would obliterate much of the sector reached fever pitch in the summer of 2017, when SPDR S&P Retail \u2014 the sector\u2019s benchmark exchange-traded fund \u2014 hit a four-year low. The fund, known as XRT, has since rallied by a fifth.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an over-reaction in 2017 and that led to pretty nice opportunities [for longs] in 2018,\u201d says Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of Alliance Bernstein\u2019s US Concentrated Growth fund.</p> <p>Investors who put money on the demise of retail that summer have lost out in many cases. Between then and last week, on a mark-to-market basis, short-sellers were down a total $562m on Home Depot, $863m on Kohl\u2019s and $885m on Target, according to data from S3 Partners. Only on a smaller selection of companies, including Bed Bath & Beyond, JCPenney and Gamestop, has the trade paid off over that time frame.</p> <p>\u201cIt was almost as if they [shorts] were acting like no retail real estate space can work,\u201d says Brad Lamensdorf, portfolio manager at Ranger Alternative Management. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we\u2019re looking at it. There\u2019s too much capacity, but that doesn\u2019t mean retail real estate is dead.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in the sector have been volatile in part because investors have had to consider a series of seemingly contradictory data points about the health of both the US consumer and the retail business. XRT lost as much as 27 per cent last year from its peak, but has since rebounded 18 per cent.</p> <p>For now, a robust economy has kept Americans spending both online and in stores. \u201cWages are still pretty good, unemployment rates low, [and] gas prices are down,\u201d said Brett Biggs, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, last week. The country\u2019s biggest retailer had just reported its biggest rise in fourth quarter like-for-like sales in a decade.</p> <p>Traditional chains are also trying to take on Amazon by improving their online offerings and making their stores more enticing. Both require hefty investment, although successful examples include Lululemon, which offers yoga lessons in its stores. Shares in the company have tripled since a 2017 low.</p> <p>\u201cThose who are innovating and investing in ecommerce, marketing and social media tend to be doing well,\u201d says Ken Murphy, fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.</p> <p>He adds, though, that several retailers are under \u201cincredible financial stress\u201d. He points to the department store chain JCPenney, whose $4.2bn long-term debt burden as of November compares with a current market capitalisation of just under $380m.</p> <p>Bears have no shortage of gloomy developments to support their case.</p> <p>A profit warning from Macy\u2019s last month triggered the biggest sell-off in its shares since its 1992 stock market launch. Government data this month showed US retail sales fell in December month-on-month by the most since 2009, although the figures were so bad that much of Wall Street questioned their accuracy.</p> <p>Investors will learn more over the next couple of weeks, when dozens of constituents of the XRT are scheduled to report earnings. In anticipation, bears this month staked out the most aggressive short positions in a year against XRT, according to S3 Partners.</p> <p>In several cases, argues Mr Lamensdorf, the market was still failing to price in the \u201cAmazon effect\u201d. He has shorts on retailers including Gap \u2014 \u201ctheir footprint is too big\u201d, a concept that is \u201ceasily copied\u201d and a brand that has \u201clost its identity\u201d \u2014 and the children\u2019s clothes chain Carters. While he is not short JCPenney, he says the company has \u201cmassive over capacity.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the shape of the economy, adds Mr Tierney, structural problems remain.</p> <p>\u201cThe US is still over-stored,\u201d he says. Ecommerce meant \u201cmore of the store base is not economic. That\u2019s going be a secular pressure for years to come. For those retailers that don\u2019t have a digital strategy, it\u2019s just a matter of time before they fall.\u201d</p>", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ba371cd4-366f-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5", "tags": ["profit warning", "lamensdorf", "share prices", "yoga lessons", "aggressive short positions"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Amazon didn't kill the retail trade.

Things like courtesy and helpfulness of store staff, call center support and even availability of merchandise on the shelves have seen drops from a year ago, he said.</p> <p>The 2018 ACSI Retail Report is based on interviews with more than 62,000 customers chosen at random and contacted by email between January and December last year.</p> <p>While Americans clearly prefer shopping online, even e-commerce showed signs of strain, dropping to an ACSI score of 80, down 2.4 percent from last year.</p> <p>Customers surveyed did not see any improvement in the online shopping experience since last year and felt most aspects of the process including desktop checkout, navigation and site performance have deteriorated. Mobile apps are the one bright spot, earning high marks for quality and reliability.</p> <p>The big news: Online giant Amazon, which held the top spot in the ACSI survey since 2010, plunged 4 percent to score an 82. Costco, which made its debut in the online category this year, scored an 83, to beat Amazon and lead the pack of the 25 internet retailers surveyed.</p> <p>Costco is the value leader among online retailers and its Kirkland brand may be part of the reason why, offering quality products at a lower price, the report noted.</p> <p>Other internet retailers that did well: Etsy, Kohls, Nike and Nordstrom all scored an 81; Apple, eBay, HP Store, Macys, Newegg, Overstock, Target and Wayfair all had an 80. Walmart (74) and Sears (73) were at the bottom of the list.</p> <p>Costco also takes the top spot in the department and discount store category, with an 83. Sams Club is close behind at 80. Both had the same scores from last year, even though customer satisfaction with the category dropped 1.3 percent to an ACSI score of 76. The third warehouse chain, BJs Wholesale Club, scored a 79 to take third place in a tie with Dillards, Kohls and Nordstrom (which saw a decline of 2 percent).</p> <p>Costco and Sams Club have figured out that customer service is critical, and they invest in it more than the bells and whistles we typically associate with other big box retailers, VanAmburg told NBC News.</p> <p>Several chains took a big hit this year: Fred Meyer, which is in the process of a major overhaul, dropped 5 percent, while Meijer was off 4 percent.</p> <p>Walmarts score rose 1 percent, but with a 72, its in next to last place. Walmarts checkout speed is the slowest in the industry and its staff are less courteous than its competitors, the report said. Beleaguered Sears, which struggles to say alive, slipped another 4 percent to score an all-time low of 70.</p> <p>The nations supermarkets also took it on the chin, with customer satisfaction in this category down 1.3 percent, for an ACSI score of 78. Except for convenience of location and store hours, all elements of the grocery shopping experience were worse than last year.</p> <p>Shoppers said brand names are less available and merchandise selection is lacking. They also felt the quality of the meat and produce has fallen, the stores arent as clean as they used to be, sales are less frequent, and the pharmacy service was worse.</p> <p>Supermarket apps were included in this years survey for the first time and scored an 82 for quality and reliability, but website satisfaction dropped 2 percent to 80. Stores that dont get the online component right will have difficulty competing as online grocery shopping becomes more popular.</p> <p>Two traditionally high-performing chains, Trader Joes and Wegmans, continued to shine with even higher scores this year. With an ACSI score of 86, Trader Joes is not only the highest-rated supermarket, its the highest-rated retailer in this survey. Wegmans is a close second at 85, followed by Aldi and Publix at 84, Costco (83), H-E-B (82) and Sams Club (80). Walmart holds on to its perennial last place, with a 72, down 1 percent.</p> <p>Why do Trader Joes and Wegmans take the top spots year after year? They take great care of their employees, which results in happy employees who are trained that the customer comes first, and they are to do what they need to do to make sure the customer experience is a great one, said industry analyst Phil Lempert, who runs the website SupermarketGuru.com.</p> <p>The big news in this category: Whole Foods dropped 2 percent to score a 79, which puts it in a tie with BJs Wholesale Club, Hy-Vee, Kroger and ShopRite.</p> <p>Considering the importance of retail to overall consumer spending, the continued decline in customer satisfaction cannot be taken lightly.</p> <p>The ACSI report suggests high employment is putting a strain on customer service because it creates staff shortages and constant turnover.</p> <p>Customer experience expert Jon Picoult, founder of Watermark Consulting, also blames short-sighted management who are dealing with competition from Amazon and other online-only retailers, by neglecting the in-store experience.</p> <p>While that might help bolster financial results for a few quarters, it has a very insidious long-term, consequence of undermining one of the few remaining sources of competitive differentiation available to traditional retailers in their battle with online rivals, Picoult told NBC News.</p> <p>Fewer employees, poorly trained staff and long lines at checkout all sour people to brick-and-mortar stores and drives them into the arms of online retailers who offer greater convenience, he said.</p> <p>Herb Weisbaum is a contributor to NBC News and writes about consumer-related issues.

Its ad sales and other revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>About 300 million shoppers visit Walmart\u2019s stores every month, and millions make online purchases on its website, according to Forrester Research. The retailer draws in more shoppers than Amazon, Facebook and Google, the research firm estimates. </p> <p>At Walmart\u2019s investor conference in October, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said its ad business was \u201ctiny\u201d and \u201cit could be bigger.\u201d He said the company\u2019s data has not been monetized. </p> <p>Walmart also said this month its online losses are likely to widen this year due to investments to expand the business, and the advertising push could offset some of that. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a unique opportunity to leverage our first-party shopping data from online and offline purchases to reach our customers and influence their purchase decisions,\u201d Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies said in an interview. </p> <p>The retailer is consolidating teams into a single group for ad sales and operations, Bratspies said. </p> <p>\u201cIt can be as simple banner ads on the website ... to in-store capabilities on our TV network,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The challenge for companies and marketers often is gauging whether their investments are yielding a return. Walmart will address that challenge by connecting data from stores and online and offering a pitch that is \u201cmuch more effective than many others can,\u201d Bratspies said. </p> <p>Trade marketing, typically used by packaged goods manufacturers to target shoppers, are moving to Amazon, according to analysts. U.S. trade marketing totals an estimated $178 billion a year and makes up most of Amazon\u2019s U.S. ad dollars, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated. </p> <p>The retailer will also ask suppliers to deliver a full truckload on time at least 87 percent of the time and expects those delivering less than a truckload to be on time at least 70 percent of the time. </p> <p>Walmart will ask suppliers to deliver full orders a minimum of 97.5 percent of the time, it added. </p>", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/walmart-suppliers-advertising-idINKCN1QF2GZ", "tags": ["consolidating teams", "amazon.com alphabet google", "trade marketing", "ask suppliers", "walmart consolidate advertising sales"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Walmart hopes to boost ad business by letting P&G, Unilever advertise in stores, online", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-suppliers-advertising-idUSKCN1QF25M"}, {"title": "Walmart is going to let big brands advertise in its stores and online to help boost its ad business", "source": "financial-post", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/walmart-is-going-to-let-big-brands-advertise-in-its-stores-and-online-to-help-boost-its-ad-business"}, {"title": "Target is inviting brands to its marketplace (TGT)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/target-inviting-brands-online-marketplace-2019-2"}]}, {"title": "Macy\u2019s and Home Depot flag slowing sales growth", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-02-26T17:56:42Z", "origContent": "<p>Two of the biggest names in US retail, Macy\u2019s and Home Depot, cautioned on Tuesday that sales growth would slow this year, in the latest mixed earnings report from the sector.</p> <p>Macy\u2019s, the department-store chain, followed up a profit warning it issued last month by forecasting that like-for-like sales would be flat or rise no more than 1 per cent in 2019, compared with a rise of 1.7 per cent at its own stores last year.</p> <p>While that is stronger than much of the retail sector, the home improvement chain\u2019s guidance for tempered growth \u2014 along with weaker than expected quarterly sales \u2014 was notable as it has a record of delivering forecast-beating results.</p> <p>Economic data also released on Tuesday showed the number of new homes built in December dropped 11 per cent from the previous month to the lowest level in more than two years.

Amazon and Walmart have been doing it for years. But, Target's approach is a little different. Instead of allowing brands and sellers to apply to be listed on the platform alongside first-party goods, Target's program is invite-only. </p> <p> \"This is intended to be a very curated and select group of products and brands,\" Target CMO and CDO Rick Gomez told CNBC. \"We are reaching out to the brands we want.\" </p> <p> Brands and sellers that have been invited so far include SVSports, Mizuno, Kaplan Early Learning Company, Serenity Health & Home D\u00e9cor, and Music123. The program is still in its early days and is likely to expand. </p> <p> The products will be sprinkled throughout the site, and there is no way to search specifically for Target + items, which are labeled with a \"ships and sold by [seller]\" marking. Customers can also return the items to Target stores and get free shipping, plus 5% off for using a Target credit card, making it similar to ordering from Target directly. </p> <p> It also helps to expand selection, with the goal of having shoppers come to the same store and buy more stuff more often. </p> <p> Target's model does sidestep a problem that some marketplaces have experienced, which is that it's challenging to effectively police goods sold on the website by third parties. Both Amazon and Walmart have run into problems with sellers breaking the platform's rules and selling offensive goods. </p> <p> But a more central problem still remains. Regulators are increasingly keeping a close eye on companies that maintain a marketplace in addition to selling products directly. </p> <p> Germany's competition watchdog \u2014 the Federal Cartel Office, or the Bundeskartellamt \u2014 announced in November that it had opened an investigation into Amazon for playing this dual role. </p> <p> \"Its double role as the largest retailer and largest marketplace has the potential to hinder other sellers on its platform,\" Andreas Mundt, the president of the FCO, said in a statement. \"Because of the many complaints we have received we will examine whether Amazon is abusing its market position to the detriment of sellers active on its marketplace. We will scrutinize its terms of business and practices towards sellers.\" </p> <p> But Germany's watchdog isn't the first to take notice of this aspect of Amazon's business and its potential anti-trust implications. The European Commission, led by Margrethe Vestager, announced in September that it had launched a preliminary investigation into whether Amazon's model has meant that its use of data has been in violation of European competition law. </p> <p> \"The question here is about the data,\" Vestager said in response to a journalist's question at a press conference in Brussels, Belgium, at the time. </p> <p> Though Target does not operate in Europe, it will still need to worry. Across the Atlantic, now-presidential hopeful US Sen. Elizabeth Warren has echoed the European regulators' sentiment.</p> <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling on Trump officials to invoke the 25th Amendment.</p> <p>Speaking with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin in September, Warren centered her criticism on the dual role Amazon plays. </p> <p> The problem, Warren says, is that Amazon gets the data from sales on its platform and doesn't necessarily share it. With that information, Amazon could then potentially create its own market conditions and develop a private-label brand, critics argue. </p> <p> \"Amazon gets this special information advantage that it [can] then exploit to wipe out [a business],\" Warren told Sorkin. \"That is a serious problem.\" </p> <p> Warren said that, ultimately, Amazon should not be in both businesses. </p>", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/target-debuts-marketplace-vs-amazon-walmart-2019-2", "tags": ["launched preliminary investigation", "presidential hopeful sen. elizabeth warren", "retail platform", "25th amendment", "third party merchandise"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Target rips a page from Walmart, Amazon, adding more items from outside sellers to website", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/26/target-like-amazon-welcomes-more-third-parties-sell-its-site/2982013002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}, {"title": "Regulatory showdown awaits for Big Tech \u2014 but who gets the job? - Financial Times", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4f9cfdba-3b7b-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0"}, {"title": "Target is inviting retailers to its website as it tries to catch up with Walmart and Amazon online", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/24/target-is-inviting-other-retailers-to-join-its-website.html"}]}, {"title": "Private Equity Faces Down Brexit Risk as KKR Looks at Asda", "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2019-02-25T18:27:12Z", "origContent": "<p>A customer pushes a shopping cart as she walks towards an Asda supermarket, operated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., in the Wembley district of London, U.K.</p> <p>It would take a brave private equity investor to pounce on a U.K. retailer like </p> <p>Walmart Inc.\u2019s Asda only five weeks before Brexit.</p> <p>J Sainsbury Plc\u2019s $9.5 billion deal to take over Asda nears collapse following tougher-than-expected </p> <p>British retailers have become more vulnerable amid the rise of e-commerce and the growth of discount retailers Aldi and Lidl.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg News)</p> <p>-- Inslee said he welcomes Ocasio-Cortezs Green New Deal for its ambition and for drawing attention to his pet issue, but he said theres not really a plan for him to endorse. This was not a policy document. It was really not meant to be, he said. So now people like me will issue policies to actually put meat on the bones.</p> <p>Republicans have warned in apocalyptic terms that the resolution could take away peoples cars and even lead to killing cows. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is moving to hold a show vote to force Democrats to take a position on the resolution. Inslee said Republicans are using scare tactics that remind him of the debate over Obamacare.</p> <p>Its just death panels all over again, he said. They squawk and they make up stuff out of thin air, just like they did on health care, and then we win. I believe, and I hope, it will be the same result on climate change.</p> <p>During our conversation at the Marriott Marquis, I noted that Democrats lost the House in 2010 after they passed the Affordable Care Act and that several congressmen lost their seats specifically because they walked the plank to vote for cap-and-trade system during the same Congress.\u00a0Timing is everything in comedy and politics, he said.</p> <p>-- Inslee explained that hes cleareyed about whats realistic. He does not think getting to a carbonless economy in a decade is doable. After his defeats of the past decade, the governor also no longer advocates for a carbon tax or a carbon-pricing system.\u00a0</p> <p>I'm proposing alternatives, he said. What's important to realize is this other assortment of tools in the toolbox can achieve the same carbon reduction as a carbon charge. There's a lot of routes to this destination.</p> <p>When cap-and-trade failed in 2010, Inslee argues that it was just a line on the graph. Now people experience more frequent fires, flooding and hurricanes, plus worse air quality, so it feels real and thus theyre inclined to act.</p> <p>While the general idea of action is popular, specific steps can generate backlash. During our interview, I noted that the mass yellow vest protests in Paris over the past few months started because of public outcry over France imposing a new tax to fight climate change. Inslee emphasized that this is partly why he does not advocate carbon taxes.</p> <p>Look, we've got a suite of policies that are available to us, not just carbon pricing, he said. In my state, we've got five bills in the legislature that are all moving forward with the goal of 100 percent clean energy. We've learned that we have multiple tools, not just one. There are a lot of different ways to skin this cat.</p> <p>Riot police in Paris run past a fire during yellow vest protests on Feb. 9. It was the 13th straight weekend of demonstrations against a new carbon tax. (Kamil Zihnioglu/AP)</p> <p>-- Inslees decision to go all in on climate is certainly calculated, but its not craven. This is not some election-year conversion. Back in 2007, Inslee co-authored a 416-page book on this topic called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy. Bill Clinton wrote the foreword.</p> <p>Inslee pointed to a poll conducted this month by the Center for American Progress, a progressive advocacy group, that found addressing the climate crisis is tied with universal health-care coverage as the top priority among Democratic voters in the five early states.</p> <p>Another poll this month from Saint Anselm College found that 88 percent of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters said they are more likely to support a candidate who advocates for the Green New Deal. That was a higher number than Medicare-for-all, regulating Wall Street, taxing the ultra-wealthy and providing tuition-free college.</p> <p>A December poll from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found 69 percent of all Americans are at least somewhat worried about climate change, up seven points from last March.</p> <p>-- Inslee said he would be willing to declare a national emergency on climate change, allowing drastic federal action that could not pass Congress, if the Supreme Court upholds President Trumps emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern border. The governor emphasized that hes against Trumps invocation of emergency powers and hopes it gets struck down. But if the rules change and the circumstances change, were going to play by whatever rules exist to deal with this existential crisis, he said. So if the possibility exists, we'll say yes.</p> <p>Jay Inslee\u00a0acknowledges his wife, Trudi, during his State of the State address in Olympia, Wash., last month. Inslee says she's as passionate as he is about tackling climate change. (Elaine\u00a0Thompson/AP)</p> <p>-- Inslee notes that he has made tangible, if incremental, progress as governor. Indeed, the Seattle Times Editorial Board praised him last month for trying to elevate the national conversation surrounding global warming and for his work to reduce emissions during six years as governor: Inslee has a compelling story to tell about the states ability to grow its economy, increase education spending and host the nations two most valuable companies all while reducing emissions, increasing use of renewable energy and enforcing strong regulations to protect the health of forests, waterways and air quality. </p> <p>Inslee secured investments in clean-energy research, pushed to increase electric vehicle use in the state and co-founded a coalition of 17 governors working to uphold the Paris Agreement on climate-change goals. Energy related greenhouse-gas emissions in Washington declined 3 percent since their pre-recession high in 2007, despite population growth and the nations fastest economic growth in recent years. Emissions are expected to fall 5.5 percent by the time Inslees current term ends in 2020 Hes been a strong advocate for private- and public-sector research and advanced product development. That includes championing state support for Boeings development of cutting-edge, fuel-efficient jetliners.</p> <p>-- Inslee has significantly more experience than most of his better-known rivals for the nomination. He got elected to the state House in 1988, won a U.S. House seat in 1992, lost reelection in 1994 because he voted for the assault weapons ban, battled his way back to Congress in 1998 and stayed there until he won the governorship in 2012. His second term wraps up at the end of 2020. Inslee also recently wrapped up a successful stint as the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.</p> <p>Right now, however, he doesnt register in the early polls.</p> <p>-- New this morning:EPA regulator skirts the line between former clients and current job, by Juliet Eilperin: Less than a month into his tenure as the top air policy official at the Environmental Protection Agency, Bill Wehrum hopped into the EPAs electric Chevy Volt and rode to the Pennsylvania Avenue offices of his former law firm. There, he met with representatives of the nations largest power companies including two groups that, shortly, had been his paying clients to brief them on the Trump administrations plans to weaken federal environmental regulations. The Dec. 7, 2017, meeting is just one example of interactions between Wehrum, a skilled lawyer and regulator, and former clients that ethics experts say comes dangerously close to violating federal ethics rules.</p> <p>Three Democrats Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Thomas R. Carper (Del.) asked the EPAs Office of Inspector General to investigate Wehrums conduct, saying it runs afoul of rules requiring federal appointees to recuse themselves from most matters involving former clients and employers for two years.</p> <p>In an interview, Wehrum [said] he has followed the letter of the law [He] acknowledges that he has met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. He also weighed in on a policy shift that could have influenced litigation involving DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility represented by his former firm.</p> <p>-- The Trump administration is moving ahead with its most deliberate effort yet to challenge accepted science on climate change and has chosen to do so in a way that will minimize transparency. The White House plans to create an ad hoc group of select federal scientists to reassess the governments analysis of climate science and counter conclusions that the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming the planet, Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Brady Dennis report. The National Security Council initiative would include scientists who question the severity of climate impacts and the extent to which humans contribute to the problem </p> <p>The idea of a new working group, which top administration officials discussed Friday in the White House Situation Room, represents a modified version of an earlier plan to establish a federal advisory panel on climate and national security. That plan championed by William Happer, an NSC senior director and a physicist who has challenged the idea that carbon dioxide could damage the planet would have created an independent federal advisory committee. The Federal Advisory Committee Act imposes several ground rules for such panels, including that they meet in public, are subject to public records requests and include a representative membership. The new working group, by contrast, would not be subject to any of those requirements.</p> <p>-- The Washington Post Editorial Board, which is independent of the news division, endorses the idea of a Green New Deal but opposes the version offered by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). Todays paper has the first editorial in a five-part series outlining what a smarter and more effective Green New Deal would look like. (Read it here.)</p> <p>Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D)\u00a0applauds at a campaign house party earlier this month in New Hampshire. (Elise Amendola/AP)</p> <p>-- Get ready for the governors.Inslee is one of four current or former governors who could soon join the fray,\u00a0Dan Balz notes in his column:\u00a0They would bring executive experience and non-Washington credentials to a contest that so far has been defined largely by candidates who make their living inside the Beltway. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper has been scouting venues for his anticipated announcement. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe is itching to run but still weighing his prospects. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the current NGA chair, has been in and out of Iowa and New Hampshire taking soundings for months. Hickenlooper is a business-friendly Democrat who eschews negative advertising. McAuliffe, too, is pro-business with a centrist philosophy and relishes political combat. Bullock, who has a reformers sensibility, was twice elected in a red state (the second time in 2016, when Donald Trump was winning Montana handily). Two of the past three Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, were governors.</p> <p>-- Half a dozen Democrats campaigned in Iowa this weekend: Kamala Harris, who drew huge crowds,\u00a0and everyone else.\u00a0Hickenlooper, Tulsi Gabbard, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Bill de Blasio all drew audiences\u00a0numbering\u00a0in the double digits.\u00a0Cleve R. Woodson Jr. and Chelsea Janes report:\u00a0At one point, Harris, Castro and Hickenlooper were at the same event, a Saturday night soup dinner in Ames. Castro entered quietly from the back and dutifully went up to tables, shook hands and introduced himself. When people noticed Harris had arrived, attendees and TV cameras gravitated toward her, blocking the rooms central aisle.</p> <p>-- Testing the waters in Iowa, de Blasio criticized Hillary Clinton. The New York Posts Julia Marsh reports: Were not going to win by talking about Donald Trump, the mayor said I have deep respect for our previous nominee I know her very well but I think a lot of us would say that was one of the mistakes, the focus on Trump, he said. He also faulted Clinton for failing to unify her party after winning the nomination. There was not a true effort to say, Okay everyone come in together. The mayor defended his progressive bona fides during a question and answer session with reporters by saying that Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren are kindred spirits. He also gave an unexpected compliment to the president saying, Dont go to sleep on Donald Trump when it comes to strategy. He should not be underestimated.</p> <p>-- Democratic candidates, desperate to break through, continue to play footsie with extreme\u00a0ideas that would make it harder to defeat Trump. The latest is retro: packing the Supreme Court.\u00a0FDR is rolling his eyes somewhere.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: At an event last week in Philadelphia, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said he was open to discussing a plan pushed by some liberal groups for the next Democratic president to appoint four new justices to the Supreme Court, bringing the total to 13. We need to set that as the level of intellectual and policy ambition that we have, which does not come naturally to our party lately, Buttigieg said. So I havent reached a considered opinion on that one yet, but I do think very bold, very ambitious ideas deserve a hearing right now. Scherer likens this kind of boldness to when Alan Cranston embraced the nuclear freeze movement as a candidate in 1984.</p> <p>-- It's not just the long shots staking out positions that could prove toxic in a general election: Elizabeth Warren opened the door in New Hampshire this weekend to paying reparations to Native Americans. They should be part of the conversation, she said. (Annie Linskey)</p> <p>-- This\u00a0pressure from the left extends down the ballot\u00a0as well: Former Colorado House speaker Crisanta Duran announced she will challenge Rep.

(Denver Channel)</p> <p>-- Bernie Sanders asked his surrogates to respectfully engage opponents and avoid bullying and harassment of any kind. HuffPosts Daniel Marans reports: During the 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders and his supporters endured criticism from backers of Hillary Clinton for the online vitriol they alleged was directed at them by some of his partisans. ... Sanders in his Saturday email said employing divisive rhetoric would be particularly counter-productive given his campaigns bottom-line goal of unseating [Trump], who is notorious for his bullying and bigotry.</p> <p>-- An effort to tie electoral votes to the popular vote is gaining momentum. NPRs Sam Brasch reports: Democrats in Colorado and New Mexico are pushing ahead with legislation to pledge their 14 collective electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote no matter who wins each state. The plan only goes into effect if the law passes in states representing an electoral majority. That threshold is 270 votes, which is the same number needed to win the presidency. Proponents of the national popular vote measures have argued that it's not political, but Republicans, who have benefited in recent elections from the Electoral College system, disagree. So far, 11 states including New York, California and New Jersey have joined the effort along with the District of Columbia, putting the effort 98 votes short of its goal.</p> <p>-- Green Book\u00a0won best picture at the Oscars, while Bohemian Rhapsody\u00a0took home four awards, the most of any film.Avi Selk\u00a0reports: The 91st Academy Awards eliminated its hosting duties, divided its trophies, and ultimately divided its audience awarding best picture to Green Book,\u00a0which critics had alternately praised for its lighthearted depiction of a black pianist and his Italian American drivers unlikely friendship in the 1960s, or condemned for shortchanging the violent bigotry of that era to focus on a heroic white character. ...\u00a0Spike Lee scored his long-in-the-making first Oscar win while three nonwhite actors Rami Malek, Regina King and Mahershala Ali won major acting awards.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2019</p> <p>-- Trump announced that he would delay increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. David J. Lynch reports: The presidents decision to delay the increase in tariffs, which would have taken effect March 2, represents a gamble that his personal intervention can smooth the way to a final deal and quiet skeptics who fear he may be too quick to capitulate to the Chinese. Writing on Twitter Sunday evening, Trump said the United States had made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. Trump, who did not set a new date for the tariff increase to take effect, also said he plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, to finalize terms of the agreement, should the talks continue to make headway. That meeting, which the president had mulled publicly on Friday, is expected late next month.</p> <p>-- A bipartisan group of 58 former senior national security officials signed a statement saying there is no basis for Trump declaring a national emergency to build his wall on the southern border. The 11-page document is mainly intended\u00a0to\u00a0support lawsuits\u00a0challenging the president's proclamation,\u00a0Ellen Nakashima reports: The joint statement, whose signatories include former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, will come a day before the House is expected to vote on a resolution to block Trumps Feb. 15 declaration.\u00a0 ...

They said they also opposed food supplies being rejected and burned while their families went hungry. The defectors said that discontent in the ranks is high but that members of the armed forces are bound by fear.

But historians say that may not be realistic. Simon Denyer reports: While it is clear that Kim would like to establish some carefully walled-off tourism and economic development zones, and learn from Vietnams experience in that regard, there is a vast difference between that and truly reforming the countrys economy. Indeed, North Koreas tolerance of private traders and markets has been matched by reports of a renewed crackdown on foreign cultural influences, such as videos of South Korean dramas and movies. Vietnams economic transformation has been enabled by granting its people significant freedoms to travel, to trade, to communicate with and learn from foreigners just as Chinas success came by unleashing its peoples entrepreneurial ability.</p> <p>-- Many experts fear Trumps desire for a deal to distract from Michael Cohen's congressional testimony this week at home\u00a0could lead him to make too many concessions to Kim. The APs Foster Klug reports: Kim could agree to give up only part of his arsenal his intercontinental missiles aimed at America, for instance, or his main nuclear reactor in return for an easing of harsh sanctions. Theres also fear that Trump will eventually orchestrate some sort of drawdown of U.S. troops from South Korea or an extended halt to U.S.-South Korean military drills. [Kim] would be taking a huge step toward cementing the North as a nuclear weapons state and, as a bonus, driving a wedge in the U.S.-South Korea alliance that the North maintains is aimed at the overthrow of the Kim family all without addressing the Norths arsenal of short- and mid-range nuclear armed missiles aimed at Seoul, Tokyo and other parts of Asia.</p> <p>-- Eight Democratic senators said in a letter that the summit must demonstrate tangible, verifiable progress on denuclearization and reducing tensions. As strong advocates for a diplomatic pathway to resolve the North Korea threat, we still believe there is a path forward for tough and principled diplomacy to secure, monitor, and verify the denuclearization of North Korea, the lawmakers wrote. (Politico)</p> <p>-- As the summit approaches, experts weigh in on Trump and Kim's relationship. Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey report:\u00a0Personal chemistry between leaders is clearly important,\u00a0said Victor D. Cha, the top North Korea adviser in the George W. Bush administration. But, he added, Is that personal relationship enough to create success in the policy? We are so far apart that the notion that the friendship alone would create a North Korean decision to give up all of their nuclear weapons is very hard to imagine.\u00a0Absent from Trumps messaging on North Korea over the past year has been any mention of human rights. The savagery of Kim and his government has been well documented and was once a rallying cry for Trump.\u00a0But over the past year, Trump has said little publicly about Kims barbarism, and officials said that in private the president has told confidants that he considers human rights in North Korea largely inconsequential to striking a denuclearization deal.</p> <p>-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo contradicted Trump by saying that North Korea remains a nuclear threat. Felicia Sonmez and Toluse Olorunnipa report: Asked by CNNs Jake Tapper whether he believes North Korea remains a nuclear threat, Pompeo responded, Yes. After last years summit with Kim in Singapore, Trump tweeted, There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea... But Pompeo on Sunday disputed that Trump had said as much. What he said was that the efforts that had been made in Singapore this commitment that Chairman Kim made have substantially taken down the risks to the American people. Its the mission of the secretary of state and the president of the United States to keep the American people secure. Were aiming to achieve that, the secretary of state said.</p> <p>-- The CNN interview reflected the fragile balance Pompeo has attempted to strike between defending the tenets of U.S. diplomacy and supporting Trumps foreign policy. The New York Timess David Sanger and Edward Wong look at Pompeos first year:</p> <p>Pompeo privately lashed out against Pence after the vice president criticized European allies for trying to save the Iran deal during a crucial meeting on the issue: Aides said he complained Mr. Pence had undermined diplomacy which one European official said included near-agreement about imposing new sanctions on Irans ballistic missile tests and prompted fresh headlines about trans-Atlantic tensions. But publicly, Mr. Pompeo never voiced his anger, keeping relations with the White House stable.</p> <p>He has lowered\u00a0expectations about what Kim might agree to this week: In private discussions with Korea experts, Mr. Pompeo has conceded that he would be lucky if the North agreed to dismantle 60 percent of what the United States has demanded. But he said even that would be more than any other administration has achieved.</p> <p>Others in the administration wince at presidential tweets.

(Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images)</p> <p>-- Japanese voters in Okinawa rejected a referendum to build a new U.S. military base on their island.Akiko Kashiwagi and Simon Denyer report: Okinawa is home to about half the 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and houses the largest U.S. air base in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. military says its presence on the island is vital not only for the defense of Japan, but also for keeping peace in the region. But Okinawans say their small island bears an unfair burden of the U.S. military presence in Japan, and on Sunday, they made their resentment felt. The results showed that 72.2 percent of voters rejected the construction of a U.S. base at Henoko, in the north of the island. The turnout was over 52 percent.</p> <p>-- Taiwan's 2020 presidential election is kicking off, and it is all about the U.S. and China.\u00a0Gerry Shih reports: For years, officials in Washington which is treaty-bound to defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression viewed [President Tsai Ing-wen]\u00a0with skepticism, if not outright concern. Now, the political calculus may be shifting at a time when the United States is stepping up its global competition against Beijing. Her Democratic Progressive Party does not recognize a 'one-China' framework that Beijing considers inviolable, and it leans toward declaring formal independence from China a provocative move that would potentially spark a devastating conflict that also pulls in the United States. But the Washington of today with a Trump administration staffed by China hawks in several key positions has warmed up to a woman who is anathema to Beijing.</p> <p>-- A growing number of civilians were killed last year in Afghanistan.\u00a0Sayed Salahuddin and Pamela Constable report: The report from the U.N.

That reflected an 11 percent overall increase from 2017, a year that also saw near-record levels of civilian war-related deaths. In the past decade, it said, more than 32,000 noncombatants have been killed and almost 60,000 injured.\u00a0</p> <p>-- A proposal from the Guatemalan Congress that would grant amnesty to more than 30 convicted former military officers who were found responsible for the deaths of nearly 200,000 during the countrys civil war has alarmed civil society groups, the U.N. and the U.S. government. Sandra Cuffe and Mary Beth Sheridan report: The bill, which is expected to be back on Congresss agenda next week, has prompted outrage from Guatemalan civil society groups and organizations representing the indigenous, who make up 40 percent of the population but more than 80 percent of the victims of wartime abuses.

Politicos Connor OBrien reports: The White House plans to stuff as much as $174 billion of its $750 billion request for national defense for the coming fiscal year into a special war fund, according to reports, allowing the administration to maintain its long-sought military buildup without violating a 2011 law aimed at reining in the deficit. The gimmick is especially striking given that Trump budget chief Mick Mulvaney once fought to limit the very same war account, known as the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. Unless both parties can negotiate a deal to lift the spending caps, it could mean a quick demise for the military's ambitious investment plans.</p> <p>-- The Trump administration is increasingly requesting supplemental information from H-1B visa applicants and denying more petitions from high-skilled foreign workers. The Wall Street Journals Louise Radnofsky report: Some 60% of companies that applied on behalf of foreign workers received requests for supplemental information in the last quarter of 2018, compared with about 46% of applicants who got the demand in the year-earlier quarter and 28% in the final quarter of 2016. The approval rate fell to 75% in the final quarter of 2018, from 83% a year earlier and 92% in the same period in 2016.</p> <p>-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Democrats would subpoena Bob Mueller if the special counsels report isnt made public. Felicia Sonmez reports: Schiff\u00a0said on ABC Newss This Week that Democrats will also subpoena Muellers report and are prepared to go to court against the Trump administration. With Muellers nearly two-year investigation believed to be coming to an end, Democrats are seeking to ramp up pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr to release the full findings of the report and setting down a marker for what course they will take if he doesnt. Rumors swirled last week that the report could be delivered before the end of the month. But a senior Justice Department official\u00a0said Friday\u00a0that the report will not be coming this week.</p> <p>-- Roger Stone said he couldnt remember which volunteer gave him the image of a judge with what resembled a crosshairs symbol that led to a full gag order.\u00a0But he did identify four members of the far-right, men-only extremist group Proud Boys who have been defending him online. BuzzFeed Newss Zoe Tillman reports: Stone identified Enrique Tarrio, Tyler Whyte, Jacob Engels, and Rey Perez as his volunteers. Tarrio is chair of the Proud Boys and last week sat behind [Trump] during a speech in Miami wearing a T-shirt that said Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong! Whyte leads a Proud Boys chapter in Florida. Engels has been involved in Proud Boys activities, but says he's a journalist embedded with the group, not a member. Perez identified himself on Facebook as a member of the Proud Boys and was at Stone's house in Florida to tape a podcast over cigars and baked ziti just before the Instagram post imbroglio. \u00a0In court last week, Stone didn't share many details about what his volunteers do for him he told the judge that they perform a lot of the clerical work but he said Engels had access to his Instagram account, Whyte posted to his Facebook account, and that multiple people had access to his phone.\u00a0</p> <p>-- Here are some steps\u00a0that may follow once\u00a0Muellers report comes out.\u00a0(Dan Keating and Aaron Steckelberg)</p> <p> Donald J.

Trump, being Trump, is erring on the side of triumphalism, boasting about the Islamic States defeatto the consternation of the counterterrorism community, which wants to stay in Syria to keep the pressure on. Its appropriate to criticize Trumps boasting as premature, but it is also important to recognize that the Islamic State has been hit hard and that the caliphates defeat marks a potential turning point. The foreign fighter flow has dried up, and the loss of territory makes it far harder for it to organize international terrorist attacks. The unusual circumstances that allowed the caliphate to briefly flourish may not soon recur, and it is unlikely that the Islamic State will soon revive at the same scale or that another front will emerge with the same appeal that Syria had. None of this, of course, means the end of jihadi terrorism.\u00a0</p> <p>New Yorker, They've got him!\u00a0The emotional scene at the R.

She stared straight ahead at Kelly, who appeared at the front of the room wearing a black sweatshirt, his face expressionless. On her way in and out of court, Clary held hands with Joycelyn Savage, a woman whose parents say also began a sexual relationship with Kelly, in 2015, when she was nineteen years old. Both women are still living with Kelly in what their parents call his cult.</p> <p>NYU social work school acknowledges institutional racism after classroom episode, from Morgan Smith: Shahem Mclaurin says he didnt go to school to be a revolutionary leader. But thats the role he has found himself in after his tweet about an incident at New York Universitys Silver School of Social Work spurred university officials to acknowledge ongoing institutional racism in their classrooms and inspired other students to criticize the Silver School for failing to address racist behavior on campus. On Feb. 12, Mclaurin described the incident in a widely shared Twitter thread. [The 24-year-old graduate student] emailed his classmates to ask if someone could connect him via FaceTime during class. No one responded. After class, one of the students emailed Shahem and explained why he didnt answer. I found it easier to lead the discussion without black presence in the room, since I do feel somewhat uncomfortable with the (perceived) threat that it poses something which I have been working on, but it will take more time than I would like it to be, the student wrote.</p> <p>Where in the world does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez live? from the New York Post: Rep.

Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district. Ocasio-Cortez has used her deceased fathers Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012 But The Post could find little indication she continues to live there. On Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona. Come downstairs, I have to take a picture quick, the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.</p> <p>I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight.

By contrast, Canada Goose jackets start from about $575 in the United States. </p> <p>\u201cWe made more money in January than we did for the whole of 2017,\u201d Chiu, 32, told Reuters at his factory in the eastern Chinese city of Jiaxing. </p> <p>He estimates his firm made $5 million in sales last month and expects to bring in $30-$40 million this year. U.S. sales - almost all of which are sold through Amazon.com Inc - account for 70 percent of total revenue. </p> <p>Orolay\u2019s success is, however, not just a tale of competitive pricing and a design that found favour with U.S. consumers. </p> <p>Chiu is among a wave of Chinese merchants that have benefited from measures introduced by Amazon in recent years that have made it easy for overseas vendors to sell on its site. </p> <p>That\u2019s provoked concerns among U.S. sellers on Amazon that they are being outgunned. And in industries such as apparel, experts say brick-and-mortar retailers cannot ignore the threat posed by the influx of small brands, many of which are based in China. </p> <p>The number of Chinese merchants on Amazon is set to grow further as fierce competition and rising costs have made it less attractive to sell on local e-commerce sites like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s Tmall, analysts say. </p> <p>Indeed, Chiu no longer sells in China. Orolay\u2019s other markets are Europe, Japan, Taiwan and Australia. </p> <p>\u201cWe did sell on Alibaba in the early days...but competition in China is stiffer,\u201d he said, adding that increased costs to use local sites was also a factor. </p> <p>In addition to fees to use Chinese e-commerce sites, sellers also face other costs such as investing in customer service teams. Alibaba declined to respond to Reuters questions about whether costs for vendors had increased. </p> <p>Analysts say the number of Chinese merchants selling on Amazon\u2019s U.S. site began to pick up over the last five years after it introduced measures that allowed sellers worldwide to store products at Amazon warehouses and provided help shipping those goods to customers. </p> <p>Late last year, the retail giant also started a program that refers China-based sellers to local lenders. By comparison, Amazon offers loans to selected U.S., UK and Japan-based small businesses that sell on its site. </p> <p>Chiu credits Amazon for much of the firm\u2019s success but is thinking of branching out, saying offers from retailers include invitations to sell online from Walmart Inc and U.S. shopping site Rue La La. </p> <p>Expansion plans include extending Orolay\u2019s product line to cotton clothing and men\u2019s outerwear. But for now, Chiu is still marvelling at how his business has become so successful in a market he barely knows. </p> <p>\u201cI went to New York for vacation twice last year, and was so excited to see that people on the street are wearing our jackets,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI was very eager to ask them how they like our jackets, but didn\u2019t do it because I don\u2019t speak much English.\u201d </p>", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/china-coat-orolay-idINKCN1QE0DS", "tags": ["local commerce sites", "u.s. consumers", "fierce competition", "eastern chinese city", "amazon.com account"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Winnipeg hospital struggles with 'all-time high' demand for warm clothing", "source": "cbc-news", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/clothing-depot-health-sciences-winnipeg-1.5033606"}, {"title": "Tesla Shift, HBO Chief, Boeing Sales: CEO Daily for March 1, 2019", "source": "fortune", "url": "http://fortune.com/2019/03/01/tesla-stores-hbo-chief-boeing-sales-ceo-daily-for-march-1-2019/"}, {"title": "Traded by Panthers, Brassard faces former team in Avs debut", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2019/02/25/traded-by-panthers-brassard-faces-former-team-in-avs-debut/39113421/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}]}]}
