The complaint comes as revenue from services has become increasingly important for Apple as it looks to counteract slowing iPhone sales.  \r\n  In a blog post detailing why Spotify filed the complaint, CEO Daniel Ek described Apple's competitive advantage: it operates the App Store through which iPhone owners download and pay for apps, while also offering its own music service that directly rivals Spotify's.  \r\n  \"In theory, this is fine,\" he wrote. \"But in Apple's case, they continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn.\"  \r\n  \"We believe this holds no practical purpose other than to force competitive services into higher cost structures and unfairly tax service activity on the iOS platform,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets' Andy Hargreaves and Tyler Parker said in the note published on March 13. As such, the firm believes Spotify's complaint has merit and could \"carry significant weight\" in the eyes of regulators.  \r\n  If Apple were forced to change its terms as a result of the complaint, it could pose a risk to the revenue Apple earns from subscriptions and in-app purchases.  \r\n  \"We believe the most significant financial risk to Apple would come from a forced requirement to allow first party and other third party payment processing from within apps,\" the note read. \"This would create competition for subscription and in-app payments that would likely drive the current 30% rate Apple collects down substantially.\"  \r\n  KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that the App Store will drive 12% of Apple's total gross profit in the 2019 fiscal year, and any major changes to the store's communication and payment terms could \"meaningfully affect\" the growth rate of Apple's services.  \r\n  Repercussions stemming from the complaint could extend beyond financial risk to the App Store and impact Apple's reputation as a brand as well, the note says. While consumers may not be concerned with the details of the complaint, it could create a prolonged period of negative Apple headlines which may in turn \"negatively impact Apple's retention rate at the margin,\" according to the note.  \r\n Jimmy Iovine announces Apple Music during Apple WWDC on June 8, 2015 in San Francisco, California. Apple's annual developers conference runs through June 12. \r\n Revenue from services like Apple Music and the App Store are more important than ever for the company as it seeks to grow other product areas as iPhone sales are lagging.  \r\n  The company said in its January earnings report that iPhone sales in the holiday quarter declined 15% compared to the year before, while global smartphone sales have stalled. Apple's services business achieved a milestone of $10.9 billion in revenue, marking an all-time high and a 19% increase from the prior year.  \r\n  But multiple reports have suggested that Apple has been struggling to come to an agreement with partners for both its video and news services. The company is rushing to secure content to offer on the service alongside its own programming according to Bloomberg, while a report from CNBC last month suggested that talks between Apple and HBO had slowed. News publishers have also been reluctant to agree to the financial terms Apple has proposed for its news service, according to The Wall Street Journal, under which it would keep half of the subscription revenue from the service.  \r\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling on Trump officials to invoke the 25th Amendment. \r\n Spotify's antitrust complaint against Apple also comes after Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a new plan that would regulate large tech firms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google and force them to roll back or otherwise divest some of their acquisitions.  \r\n  The plan would designate major tech services as \"Platform Utilities\" and would prevent companies from operating a marketplace and competing in that same marketplace.  \r\n  Although Warren didn't initially mention Apple in her proposal, she said in an interview with The Verge that Apple should be regulated too. \r\n  \"It's got to be one or the other,\" she said. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-apple-trust-complaint-risk-2019-3", "tags": ["brian wieser", "key challenge", "credit card details", "sure services", "digital currency endeavors"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Facebook's messaging ambitions amount to much more than chat", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/8f89a37ed0314c429b8250d67acd0bcd"}, {"title": "The Technology 202: EU's top competition cop says Amazon probe in 'quite advanced' stage", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/03/12/the-technology-202-eu-s-top-competition-cop-says-amazon-probe-in-quite-advanced-stage/5c86f5271b326b2d177d6057/"}, {"title": "Tech giants should \u2018open up their customer data to others\u2019", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4180f5e6-44b4-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb"}]}, {"title": "The Daily 202: Russia may experiment with new forms of interference in Ukraine\u2019s elections, experts warn", "source": "the-washington-post", "date": "2019-03-13T14:04:22Z", "origContent": "THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0The Russians could use the looming Ukrainian elections as a proving ground to test innovative forms of interference that might, if successful, be weaponized against the United States during the 2020 presidential campaign. \r\n I consider Ukraine ground zero when it comes to foreign meddling in elections because a lot is at stake for Russia, former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an interview. We don't know in advance which technologies Russia will use. We do know that they will come up with more and more sophisticated methods. That's why we need to be at the forefront by witnessing what they are actually doing. \r\n Rasmussen runs a group called the Alliance of Democracies. Its flagship initiative is the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, whose co-chairs include former vice president Joe Biden and former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff. \r\n The Alliance is deploying seven observers to monitor the Ukrainian elections. The first round of voting is March 31. Assuming no presidential candidate in the crowded field gets more than 50 percent, a runoff will be held on April 21. \r\n The groups goal is to draw attention to disinformation and to work with the private sector to combat the proliferation of new technologies that keep intelligence professionals up at night, especially deep fake audio and video files. These are doctored but appear amazingly authentic and can go viral on social media. \r\n Rasmussen, who also formerly served as the prime minister of Denmark, led NATO in 2014 when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Five years later, Russian forces are still on the peninsula and Ukraines deadly conflict with Russian-backed separatists drags on. \r\n No doubt about it, we were taken by surprise when he attacked Ukraine, Rasmussen said. I dont think we underestimate Russia any longer. \r\n We met for lunch at Sonoma on Capitol Hill after he testified before the House Intelligence Committee recently. Over hamburgers, he outlined machinations by Moscow that he worries are still going on under the radar and expressed hope that Washington elites can avoid viewing the response through a partisan lens. \r\n The whole purpose is not to strengthen left wings or right wings, but it's just to sow mistrust and lack of confidence in our democratic institutions and our democratic process, Rasmussen said. That would be true whether it was President Trump in the White House or someone else. \r\n There is strong evidence that the Russians have interfered to varying degrees during elections abroad by using traditional propaganda, manipulating social media platforms and in some cases illicitly funding allies. Rasmussen pointed to a recent report by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that found Russia is responsible for 80 percent of disinformation activities in Europe and highlighted Microsofts recent announcement that it detected efforts by Moscow to phish the servers of European think tanks. \r\n In Ukraine, the Transatlantic Commission has partnered with the Atlantic Council and the Victor Pinchuk Foundation to stand up an elections task force. Its led by David Kramer, the former president of Freedom House and an assistant secretary of state under George W. Bush. The operation includes a rapid-response war room aimed at identifying evidence of interference in real-time by using sophisticated new software tools. \r\n We should not forget that in many Eastern European countries people say, We did not get rid of communism just to replace Moscow with Brussels, so we have to carefully consider how we speak up, Rasmussen explained. \r\n Officials are on edge that agents of the Kremlin could try to hack into the networks of the various candidates or disable phones, electrical grids and maybe even airport control systems. Their intent could range from suppressing get-out-the-vote operations to making the government look incompetent at the most inopportune moments to simply creating mass chaos. \r\n Western observers are also nervous that Russia will try to hack into the Ukrainian elections website to publish false results in a bid to cast doubts on the validity of the real results. This isnt academic. It happened during their last presidential election. A pro-Russian hacking group called CyberBerkut deleted vote-tallying system files and leaked private emails from the Central Election Commission. The public-facing results website was also hacked. It falsely identified a far-right candidate as the winner until authorities could regain control of their servers. \r\n Unlike in U.S. elections, the Ukrainians must also worry about the real possibility of Russia using conventional military force, whether harassing their ships in the Sea of Azov or massing troops along the border or activating sleeper cells inside Kiev to conduct sabotage and foment violence in the streets. \r\n We need to pay more immediate attention to Ukraine because it is not part of NATO and they are in many ways a symbol of some of the things going on, said former secretary of state Madeline Albright, who testified alongside Rasmussen before the House Intelligence Committee. We are still underestimating Russia. Putin is just a flat-out dictator. I used to be a Soviet expert and I kind of look at my library and I think its archaeology. Nope! They are trying to rebuild the system, and theyre using these asymmetrical tools. \r\n -- After reading an op-ed Biden wrote that called for a 9/11-style commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rasmussen reached out to him about partnering on something more global. Last March, they unveiled the transatlantic initiative together. It has already monitored 10 referendums and elections, including the U.S. midterms. \r\n They were especially alarmed to see what happened last September in Macedonia during a referendum on changing the countrys name, which might have sped up the countrys entry into NATO a development Russia strongly opposes. There was a surge in new Facebook and Twitter bot accounts during the month before the vote that urged people to boycott, abstain and stay home. Rasmussen believes the Russians were trying to keep turnout rates below 50 percent so that the results would be invalid. Ultimately, turnout was only 37 percent. \r\n We detected some unusual activity on social media, but it was a bit difficult for us to identify the origin, and this is the reason why we didn't make it public, he said. But we reported our results to the local authorities, the state authorities, so its for them to look into whether it was domestic meddling or whether foreign actors intervened. In general, the state of the midterm elections was much, much better than in 2016. But we also know that the Russians have become much more sophisticated so we have to keep up the pace. \r\n -- Dont forget: One of the crimes Paul Manafort will be sentenced for by a federal judge in Washington today is his undisclosed work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Special counsel Bob Muellers team alleged last month that the former Trump campaign chairman was still working on Ukrainian political matters in 2018, even after his indictment. Manafort purportedly met with Konstantin Kilimnik to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine on more than one occasion, including in August 2016. This has long been a top foreign policy goal for Putin because a settlement is a prerequisite to the West to relax stiff sanctions on Russia. Prosecutors have also said that Manafort worked with Kilimnik on a poll of Ukraine just last year. \r\n Five years after the countrys pro-Western revolution, its people still thirst for change. Street protests in 2014 marked a decisive turn away from Moscow, but they did far less to modernize the economy or root out corruption. President Petro Poroshenkos government and administration have been beset by infighting and state spending scandals. The economy, suffering from weak investor confidence and the war in the heavily industrial east, still hasnt recovered from its near-collapse five years ago. The most prominent candidates heading into the election campaign represented the old guard: the incumbent Poroshenko, who is also a chocolate tycoon and one of Ukraines richest men, and the former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. \r\n Were living in a parallel universe, said a senior Western diplomat in Kiev, who has been catching up on the show. People are confusing whats real and whats fiction. \r\n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first published data about fentanyl in 2013, years before senior administration officials took concrete steps against the drug: The first signs were detected in the spring of 2013 when overdose deaths spiked at the state morgue in Providence. Then-Rhode Island Health Director Michael Fine wondered: What was killing so many so quickly? Fine was surprised to learn when the toxicology reports came back that 12 people who overdosed between March and May had died from fentanyl. On Aug. 30, 2013, the CDC in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report highlighted the unusual spike in Rhode Island. It didnt attract much national attention. \r\n Former attorney general Eric Holder received a briefing on fentanyl in June 2014 but didnt take action: Former DEA agents said they provided Holder with a personal briefing that included a 30-slide PowerPoint presentation about the dangers of fentanyl While raising red flags, the PowerPoint presentation itself did not request any particular action. [Holders] former spokesman said it was up to the DEA to ask the attorney general for specific action. Ten months after the briefing, Holder left the administration. By then, fentanyl was spreading across the country. \r\n Officials\u00a0rejected a May 2016 plea from national health experts to declare the crisis a public health emergency: The epidemic had been escalating for three years. The 11 experts pressed the officials to declare fentanyl a national public health emergency that would put a laserlike focus on combating the emerging epidemic and warn the country about the threat. The administration considered the request but did not act on it. \r\n Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) personally warned Obama about the explosion of fentanyl in March 2016.\u00a0But the president wouldnt specifically call it out until his administration's\u00a0final days: Markey\u00a0joined Obama on Air Force One for a trip to Atlanta, where both were scheduled to speak at the National Rx Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit. The senator used the rare one-on-one time to tell the president about fentanyl. On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis. \r\n -- The Federal Aviation Administration is standing by its decision not to ground the type of Boeing aircraft that went down in Ethiopia. Michael Laris, Lori Aratani, Josh Dawsey and Toluse Olorunnipa report: The Trump administration resisted bipartisan calls to temporarily suspend use of the Boeing 737 Max 8, even as President Trump consulted by phone with the besieged companys CEO. ... With the European Union and others following Chinas move to bar flights by some of the American aviation giants most important airplanes, former transportation safety officials said the [FAA] risked losing its status as the worlds aviation safety leader. In a conversation with Trump on Tuesday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg argued to keep the planes in the sky, according to a senior administration official. The president has not made a final decision on what should be done in response to the Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia and Indonesia crashes, the official said, and is expected to have more meetings Wednesday. ... \r\n Former U.S. transportation secretary Ray LaHood, who was a GOP congressman before being appointed by President Barack Obama, said current Secretary Elaine Chao should immediately ground the aircraft. But acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell said late Tuesday that his agencys extensive review of aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boeing 737 MAX . . . shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. \r\n --\u00a0Chao flew on the Max 8 from Austin to Washington yesterday. \r\n -- Meanwhile, a growing chorus of lawmakers from both parties is demanding the 737 Max 8\u00a0should be banned from U.S. airspace for now.\u00a0Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said the FAA should ground the planes out of an abundance of caution for the flying public. So did Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.).\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on aviation and space, promised to quickly hold a hearing to investigate the crashes. (John Wagner and Felicia Sonmez) \r\n -- Pilots repeatedly complained for months to federal authorities about a safety\u00a0feature\u00a0for months before Sundays crash. The Dallas Morning Newss Cary Aspinwall, Ariana Giorgi and Dom DiFurio report: [A]t least five complaints about the Boeing model [were found] in a federal database where pilots can voluntarily report about aviation incidents without fear of repercussions. The complaints are about the safety mechanism cited in preliminary reports about an October plane crash in Indonesia that killed 189. Records show that a captain who flies the Max 8 complained in November that it was unconscionable that the company and federal authorities allowed pilots to fly the planes without adequate training or fully disclosing information about how its systems were different from previous 737 models. \r\n -- The decision not to ground the planes is the latest example of a passive Department of Transportation,\u00a0writes\u00a0the Wall Street Journals Scott McCartney:\u00a0Thirty-five Congressional mandates sit unanswered, on everything from minimum seat space to secondary barriers protecting cockpits. The top job at the Federal Aviation Administration has been open for 14 months. Enforcement fines against major U.S. airlines have dropped 88% in the past two years, even as three-hour tarmac delays have more than doubled. The Transportation Department under Secretary Elaine Chao has seemingly been delayed on a number of issues important to travelers.\u00a0Even with airlines begging for rules on emotional-support animals, and both Republicans and Democrats expressing concerns about swollen fees, shrunken seating and punitive airline policies, the DOT has been loath to issue new regulations.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Sales of Boeing planes have been important to President Trumps trade and employment objectives. But pressure is mounting, and if investigators find the same system is responsible for both crashes, it will be increasingly difficult for the FAA and Ms. Chao to leave a plane with a fatal flaw in the air. \r\n -- Trump has a\u00a0lifelong fascination with air travel. Shortly before taking office, Trump threatened to cancel a contract with Boeing for a new Air Force One, saying the costs were too high. Trump, who reached a $3.9\u00a0billion deal with Boeing last year ...\u00a0He also considered appointing his personal pilot to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, and he told a group of airline executives in 2017 that the federal governments air-traffic-control system was 'terrible'\u00a0and 'out of whack.'\"\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa reports. \r\n Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie named himself the next secretary of defense. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) \r\n -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie promoted himself to the White House to be Trumps next secretary of defense.\u00a0Lisa Rein, Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report:\u00a0Former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan, has been auditioning for the role as acting secretary since early January. ... [He] is widely expected at the Pentagon to be nominated as permanent secretary, but officials have said theres no certainty about his elevation until a White House announcement. The president has been known to change his mind on personnel decisions. Shanahans limited foreign policy experience, particularly with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has prompted some uneasiness on Capitol Hill. Its unclear whether Trump has considered him as a serious candidate for defense secretary, although the president is said to hold him in high regard. VA spokesman Curt Cashour said in an email that Wilkie remains 100 percent focused on his job as VA secretary.\u00a0 Shanahan is scheduled to give his first congressional testimony as acting secretary this week, when he is sure to face tough questions about Trumps defense policies. \r\n Cardinal George Pell arrives at the County Court in Melbourne, Australia.

(Mark Maske) \r\n -- Fifty people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, were charged for allegedly participating in a multimillion-dollar scheme to get their children admitted to prestigious colleges. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: The allegations included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others. In Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBIs Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged. Huffman appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bond. None of the students were charged in the case. \r\n The scheme's main architect, William Singer, pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with investigators since September: Officials described Singer as a well-connected college admissions adviser and say he disguised the bribery scheme as a charity, enabling parents to deduct the bribes from their taxes. Singer was charged with taking about $25 million from 2011 to 2018 paying some of it to college coaches or standardized-testing officials for their help rigging the admissions process and pocketing the rest, according to the criminal complaint. Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges for racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said that a month after he came to the governments side, Singer alerted several people under investigation about the inquiry which earned him the obstruction charge. \r\n After the charges were unveiled, several of the implicated coaches were fired or put on leave by their universities: Prosecutors also charged Georgetowns former head tennis coach, Gordon Ernst. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits when they were not tennis players of that caliber. After leaving Georgetown, Ernst was hired as the University of Rhode Islands tennis coach. The school said Tuesday he had been placed on administrative leave. Some of the money was directed to Donna Heinel, a USC athletics official, the complaint alleges. Jovan Vavic, the former water polo coach at USC, was charged with taking bribes to pretend students flagged by Singer were recruits for the team. USC said Tuesday that Heinel and Vavic had been fired. \r\n -- Stanford fired head sailing coach John Vandemoer after he agreed to plead guilty in the case.\u00a0We have no evidence that the conduct involves anyone else at Stanford or is associated with any other team. However, we will be undertaking an internal review to confirm that, the university said in a statement sent to alumni. \r\n -- If the students werent acing their admission exams, who was? Mark Riddell, a professional tennis player and a really smart guy, according to the feds. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports:\u00a0The brains behind the operation were provided by Riddell, 36, who is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Wednesday. He was the one actually filling in the bubbles, prosecutors allege Riddell has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering. He has been cooperating in the investigation since February of this year, prosecutors said, in the hope of obtaining leniency when he is sentenced. \r\n -- The NCAA is now investigating the college coaches who took bribes.\u00a0Amy B Wang and Des Bieler report: The allegations cast an ugly light not only on the often enigmatic college admissions process but on the world of college athletic recruitment. In the wake of the charges, the NCAA said it would investigate the extent of fraud and bribery alleged by the Justice Department. The charges brought forth today are troubling and should be a concern for all of higher education, the NCAA said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. We are looking into these allegations to determine the extent to which NCAA rules may have been violated. Its unclear what violations those would include or which schools would be involved. \r\n -- Ironically, Loughlins Full House character, Aunt Becky, stopped her fictional husband from lying to get their children admitted into an elite preschool during a 1993 episode. (Allyson Chiu) \r\n -- This scandal is further proof that helicopter parenting has gotten out of hand.\u00a0Amy Joyce, our On Parenting editor, has a smart take: We have gotten to the point in todays fast-paced, hyper-competitive society where parents of privilege are hiring multiple tutors for kids already on the honor roll. Parents write college essays, or hire someone else to do it. Theyre overscheduling kids with extracurriculars that play to college admissions instead of their childrens actual interests. It sounds like overkill, and yet everyone else is doing it. So why not me? they think. The reason: Our kids will grow up to be adults who dont know how to do simple adult things. \r\n -- Lower-profile sports like volleyball, water polo and tennis are at the center of the scandal.\u00a0These sports get little attention from fans or the press, but like football and basketball they often get reserved slots in a colleges incoming class.The Timess Marc Tracy and Billy Witz report: Unlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation. The practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. \r\n Rep. Adam Schiff\u00a0(D-Calif.) speaks to reporters following a closed door House Intelligence Committee meeting with Michael Cohen. (Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg) \r\n -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Trump should probably be indicted after he leaves office for his involvement in\u00a0crimes to which\u00a0Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty. Its very difficult to make the argument that the person who was directed and was coordinated should go to jail, but the person who did the directing and coordinating should not, Schiff said at a gathering of journalists. So I think that that militates very strongly in favor of indicting the president when he is out of office. From Karoun Demirjian: [Schiff] continued to defer to the eventual judgment of the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors there have the evidence to prove the case. But after two days of closed-door sessions in which the intelligence panel interviewed Cohen, Schiff seemed confident that such documentary evidence exists, given that prosecutors indictment of Cohen essentially names the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. \r\n -- A newly released transcript of Lisa Pages testimony before the House Judiciary Committee showed how the former FBI lawyer defended the bureau against allegations of bias. Karoun Demirjian, Aaron Blake and Rosalind S. Helderman report: Page, who came to prominence over anti-Trump texts she exchanged with former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok while both were assigned to the Clinton and Trump investigations, stressed that senior bureau officials were also expressing anti-Clinton animus but that neither affected how agents working those cases carried out their jobs. Pages transcript\u00a0is the second released in the past week by the panels ranking Republican, Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), in an effort to make public the record of the now-completed GOP-led probe of how federal law enforcement agencies conducted the two probes. \r\n -- Paul Manafort faces his second sentencing at a D.C. court this morning.\u00a0A federal judge could sentence Trump's former campaign manager\u00a0to up to 10 years in prison for crimes related to unregistered foreign lobbying and witness tampering, which are unrelated to Manafort's\u00a0work on the Trump campaign. (ABC News) \r\n -- Bob Mueller said Michael Flynn has completed his cooperation with the special counsel's\u00a0investigation. Trumps former national security adviser, however, is still helping out with another federal probe. (Reuters) \r\n -- Mueller may eventually produce two reports on his investigation, one focusing\u00a0on crimes and another on\u00a0alleged coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, former federal prosecutor Nelson W. Cunningham writes for the Daily Beast. Significantly, unlike a final criminal report, a Mueller counterintelligence report cannot be bottled up. By statute it must be shared with Congress. [I]t is Muellers counterintelligence report we should really be anticipating. Done well (and Mueller and his team seem to do everything well), it will provide a much richer, broader narrative description of Russias effort to interfere in 2016, the nature of any links or cooperation between the Russians and the Trump campaign, and whether Trump or his associates were witting or unwitting assets for the Russians (including by obstructing the investigation) as well perhaps as conclusions for action. \r\n -- But ... a jittery Washington cant wait any longer for Mueller to deliver. The New York Timess Nicholas Fandos and Noah Weiland report: Television crews have been positioned outside the offices of the special counsel, the federal courthouse and, at least before they were asked to leave, the McLean, Va., home of the new attorney general, William P. Barr. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are so desperate for hints that they are asking aides to call Justice Department contacts to beg for morsels. Publishing houses are scrambling to produce instant books of the findings.\u00a0 Real information actually, any information at all from Mr. Muellers astonishingly leak-free team is almost nonexistent. The result is energetic spinning from both parties, who have stepped into the void to try to frame the next chapter of Mr. Trumps presidency. \r\n -- The New York attorney generals subpoena of Deutsche Bank is related to three loans the bank approved for the presidents company and another loan Trump sought to buy the Buffalo Bills. David A. Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell report: Trump got $125 million to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170 million to create Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69 million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Trumps tower in Chicago. In addition, the people said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trumps attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2013 a deal that did not materialize. \r\n -- Michael Avenatti is no longer serving as Stormy Danielss attorney. Felicia Sonmez reports: Daniels said in a tweet that she has retained\u00a0Tulsa-based attorney Clark Brewster\u00a0as her personal attorney and has asked him to review all legal matters involving her. \r\n Guests at the safari party included not only Danilochkin but also Israel Joffe, an official at the FDA, and Li Cindy Yang, the former owner of the massage parlor at the center of an investigation that snared Patriot owner Robert Kraft and others last month, illustrating the way that Trumps private clubs offer a lightly regulated channel into the presidents social circle. \r\n -- The White House and several Republican senators are negotiating a deal that could lead to the surprising defeat of a Democratic resolution rejecting\u00a0Trumps emergency declaration at the border.Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner report: Key to quelling the GOP revolt is legislation drafted by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that tries to claw back some emergency powers to Congress and whether the White House endorses some version of it. That would give Republicans who are uneasy about the constitutionality of the Feb. 15 declaration yet nervous about publicly rebuking Trump some political cover to side with the president. Although four Republican senators have already announced they will vote to nullify the presidents emergency declaration, one of them Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) publicly indicated Tuesday after a private meeting with Vice President Pence that he could change his position if the administration and senators strike a deal on revising the National Emergencies Act. That would be enough to kill the resolution in the Senate, provided no other GOP senators oppose Trumps declaration or alter their position. \r\n -- House Democrats presented a broad immigration proposal allowing more than 2 million immigrants the opportunity to apply for citizenship, including dreamers and those with temporary work permits who could soon be deported.\u00a0Maria Sacchetti, Erica Werner and David Nakamura report:\u00a0It is unclear how many immigrants would benefit from the legislation, but congressional aides said the number of dreamers probably would be similar to the 2.1 million people who would have been covered under a bipartisan Senate measure that was proposed in 2017, according to the Migration Policy Institute. \r\n -- The Trump administration is planning to close all international immigration offices in the coming months. Maria Sacchetti and Nick Miroff report: USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna said in an email to staff Tuesday that he is working to transfer those duties now performed by employees worldwide to domestic offices and the State Departments embassies and consulates. Administration officials say the move will allow them to shift resources to slash backlogs in the United States, and they estimate the government will save millions of dollars each year by phasing out USCIS international offices. But immigration advocates worry it is another Trump administration effort to discourage foreigners from attempting to come to the United States, and experts say closing the offices will shrink the nations engagement with the rest of the world. \r\n -- Two-hundred forty\u00a0migrants were sent back to Mexico under an experimental policy requiring Central American migrants to stay there while U.S. asylum claims are processed. Nick Miroff reports: The policy, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, has been expanded in recent days to the Calexico port of entry in California, said Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the implementation of the measures. Immigrant legal advocates are seeking an injunction in federal court to block [the policy],\u00a0which the Trump administration says is necessary to contend with a recent surge of border crossings. \r\n -- Trumps continued demands for wall money ignore the difficulty that Customs and Border Patrol has had in hiring and retaining officers. The\u00a0Cipher Briefs Walter Pincus reports: The ability to retain officers is affected by ongoing staff shortages which have required current CBP officers to work overtime. Another major retainment problem has been that some officers are required to work for years in remote areas of the border where there are few schools and a lack of jobs for spouses. Recruitment is another story. In the past, only one out of 130 [CBP] prospects ever made it all the way through the process. Today, that figure is still only about three percent. \r\n -- In El Salvador, deportees\u00a0from the United States\u00a0continue battling the poverty, violence and\u00a0crime they hoped to escape. National Geographic's Jason Motlagh and Moises Saman documented the deportation procedures of a group of Salvadorans for this month's\u00a0issue of the magazine: The deportees from\u00a0the United States file out of the buses with their heads down, stripped of belts and shoelaces like criminals. Rounded up from immigration detention centers around the country, theyd been boarded onto an unmarked jet near the Texas-Mexico border early in the morning and flown more than 1,100 miles to an airport outside El Salvadors capital, San Salvador. In just four hours a perilous journey north that had taken many of the migrants years to prepare for and weeks to complete was undone. \r\n Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took back an office from Vice President Pence.\u00a0(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) \r\n -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reclaimed office space in the House that her predecessor Paul Ryan had given to Vice President Pence.NPRs Susan Davis reports: Republicans gave Pence, a former House member, a first-floor bonus office in the U.S. Capitol shortly after President Trump was inaugurated in 2017. The vice president rarely used the space, but it was a symbolic gesture of the warm relationship Pence enjoyed with Ryan and the House GOP. While Pelosi revoked Pence's office privileges, the aide said she is providing new office space for the White House legislative affairs team that it did not previously enjoy under the GOP majority. \r\n -- Pelosis assertion that impeaching Trump wouldnt be worth the ensuing political firestorm\u00a0shines a light on the speakers cautious approach to oversight. Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report: Pelosis allies believe her skepticism about impeachment protects her moderates in swing districts, gives her an exit strategy should [Mueller]\u00a0find no wrongdoing by the president, and could even strengthen her leverage if something serious arises and Pelosi reverses course to impeach him later. Tamping down impeachment talk also enables Pelosi to keep the spotlight on the Democratic agenda, she told lawmakers in a private meeting Monday night. Thats critical amid Republican efforts to cast Democrats as obsessed with ousting the president, Pelosi allies argue. Do we want to drag him down or do we want to lift people up? Pelosi asked a group of her peers during a Monday night huddle. \r\n --\u00a0Democratic lawmakers agreed to refrain from\u00a0questioning Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rosss possible ethics violations during a hearing today\u00a0on the Trump administrations decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. He will instead be required to respond in writing.\u00a0Rachael Bade reports: Democrats agreed to the billionaires request about his 2018 financial disclosure form that a U.S. government watchdog said violated his ethics agreement, according to correspondence between the two parties obtained by The Washington Post. Ross also tried in recent days to postpone the Oversight hearing to April 9, according to the correspondence. But Oversight investigators responded that the hearing had been scheduled for months and that Ross had plenty of time. \r\n -- Republicans voted on party lines to advance Trumps judicial nominee Neomi Rao to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit.\u00a0She once said women could avoid becoming victims of date rape by staying sober. Rao will receive her final confirmation vote today. (HuffPost) \r\n -- After much public shaming, paid internships are a reality once again on\u00a0Capitol Hill. Congress approved a maximum monthly salary of $1,800 for interns. Paul Kane reports: Paying interns used to be common practice .... but it turned into an office-by-office decision when funds were cut for deficit reduction. [A] 2017 survey showed that more than 90 percent of House offices did not pay interns, while in the Senate, 51 percent of GOP offices and 31 percent of Democratic ones paid their interns. A year later, sufficiently shamed as cheapskates, Congress bowed to the pressure, approving $14 million as an initial down payment for interns. \r\n Anti-Brexit supporters\u00a0take part in a protest outside the House of Parliament in London. (Tim Ireland/AP) \r\n -- The British Parliament overwhelmingly rejected Theresa Mays Brexit plan, lowering the chances Britain will leave the European Union on March 29. William Booth and Karla Adam report: Last-minute negotiations with E.U. leaders were not enough to secure the support of hard-liners in the prime ministers Conservative Party 75 Tories voted against their leader. The loss raises questions not only about Mays authority but also about how Britain will exit the trading bloc. With just over two weeks before the Brexit deadline, the options are narrowing. Parliament will vote Wednesday on whether to leave the European Union on schedule, on March 29, without a deal European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters ... that the union was not willing to reopen talks. \r\n -- Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's regime in Venezuela announced that opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u00a0is being investigated in connection with possible sabotage of the national electrical system that has left the country in a blackout for nearly a week. Mary Beth Sheridan and Anthony Faiola report: Guaid\u00f3 was already under investigation for violent occurrences in the country since January, when his opposition movement took off. He brushed off the new allegations. We know who is responsible for the tragedy that our country is living, and its Maduro, he said, appearing at anti-government demonstrations around Caracas. Analysts said they doubted that the popular opposition leader would be detained. \r\n -- Luis Carlos D\u00edaz, the Venezuelan journalist detained by police on Monday night, was released after being charged with instigating crime. Hes barred from leaving the country without authorization and must show up to court in eight days. Bloombergs Patricia Laya and Jose Orozco report: Diaz was grabbed Monday by intelligence police while biking home from Union Radio, according to his wife. \r\n -- A new document reveals\u00a0the Navy and its industry partners are being held under cyber siege by Chinese hackers who have stolen national security secrets by exploiting critical weaknesses in U.S.\u00a0cybersecurity systems. Wall Street Journals Gordon Lubold and Dustin Volz report: The 57-page document is especially scathing in its assessment of how the Navy has addressed cybersecurity challenges facing its contractors and subcontractors, faulting naval officials for not anticipating that adversaries would attack the defense industrial base and for not adequately informing those partners of the cyber threat. It also acknowledges a lack of full understanding about the extent of the damage. \r\n -- The AFL-CIO criticized the Green New Deal as not achievable or realistic, which could threaten 2020 Democrats support of the proposal. Colby Itkowitz, Dino Grandoni and Jeff Stein report: Support for the Green New Deal has become a benchmark for Democrats running for president. But the AFL-CIO throwing water on the plan complicates matters for Democrats who rely on labor support. Without the backing from unions or the business community, it will be a hard sell for Democrats to get it beyond grass-roots support. [AFL-CIO leaders] urged the lawmakers to include labor in conversations related to climate change, but they said such work shouldnt impinge on other priorities such as infrastructure. \r\n -- Pete Buttigiegs campaign said it saw its biggest fundraising day in the 24 hours after the mayors widely praised CNN town hall. CNNs Dan Merica reports: According to the Buttigieg aide, the mayor raised more than $600,000 from over 22,200 donations in the 24 hours after the CNN town hall. The number is even more significant, the aide said, because the committee employs 20 staffers, lean when compared to other Democratic operations. \r\n -- 2020 Democratic candidates are siding with the marijuana industry in the fight for marijuana legislation,\u00a0writes Keith Humphreys:\u00a0Presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has introduced a bill removing marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act, a proposal that has been endorsed by [several] fellow Democratic candidates In a Democratic primary in which most candidates are trying to prove their left-wing credentials, it may be ironic that such a corporate-friendly form of legalization has caught on. But that may be because the implications of the proposal and the less profit-driven legalization alternatives available havent gotten much attention. Descheduling marijuana without conditions provides a handsome taxpayer-funded gift to the for-profit cannabis industry. \r\n ....a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history, especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors? \r\n  Donald J.

Happy 110th, Virginia. https://t.co/FuNZV3RRV4 \r\n Appeals court rules Ohio can defund Planned Parenthood, from Politico: A majority of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that Ohio can cut state funding to Planned Parenthood because the organization performs abortions, overturning a lower court ruling that blocked the state from stripping about $1.5 million of annual support from the network of clinics. The case was one of several across the country addressing attempts to cut public dollars to Planned Parenthood and other providers who offer abortions in addition to a range of health care services. The 6th Circuit's ruling affects six state public health programs in Ohio, but doesn't touch Medicaid. Four of the 11 Sixth Circuit judges who sided with Ohio in Tuesday's decision were appointed by [Trump]. Eric Murphy, the attorney who argued on Ohios behalf for cutting funding to the clinics, has since been appointed by Trump to the court and was confirmed by the Senate in early March. \r\n Trump will receive his intelligence briefing and later be briefed on drug trafficking at the southern border.

That compared with analysts\u2019 average forecast of 407 million pounds and 374 million in 2017-18.  \r\n The company, which trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s Asda in annual sales, said total revenue rose 2.7 percent to 17.7 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales up 4.8 percent, though growth did slow in its fourth quarter.  \r\n \u201cWe remain confident that Morrisons still has many sales and profit growth opportunities ahead, and expect that growth to be meaningful and sustainable,\u201d the firm said.  \r\n Shares in Morrisons, up 6 percent this year prior to the update, were down 1 percent at 0913 GMT.  \r\n Potts joined Morrisons in 2015 to lead a recovery after it was hit by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern England heartlands and strategic errors by previous management.  \r\n Although the discounters are still winning market share from all of Britain\u2019s big four grocers, Potts has delivered three years of like-for-like sales growth thanks to more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability as well as better customer service in refurbished stores.  \r\n He has also overhauled Morrisons\u2019 online strategy through a renegotiated deal with Ocado and struck wholesale supply deals with Amazon, the McColl\u2019s convenience chain, MPK Garages forecourt stores, Channel Islands retailer Sandpiper and Big C in Thailand.  \r\n Morrisons is also unique among its major competitors in making half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells. It says two thirds of what it sells is British.  \r\n Potts said this set-up meant it was protected if the government imposed tariffs on some imported goods in a no-deal Brexit scenario.

His 2020 budget is no different: it seeks to slash\u00a0the Office of National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent\u00a0 even as a record high of 70,000 people died from overdoses\u00a0in 2017.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n Trump has proposed moving\u00a0two major grant programs out of ONDCP and\u00a0sharp\u00a0cuts to Medicaid, the core program\u00a0providing\u00a0health care\u00a0for people suffering from\u00a0substance-abuse disorder. The president also wants to impose\u00a0work requirements on Medicaid recipients\u00a0while slashing drug prevention\u00a0efforts at the Justice Department, moves that fly in the face of Trump's\u00a02016 campaign promise to solve the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 \r\n Overall, Trump's budget proposes slashing prevention efforts by 5 percent\u00a0across agencies and increasing\u00a0interdiction efforts.\u00a0 \r\n The budget plan does propose some new funding to fight the opioid crisis, including $245 million over 10 years to let states 'extend Medicaid coverage for pregnant women with substance use disorder to one year postpartum, Vox's German Lopez reports. Last year, his budget plan called for an additional $7 billion for 2019. This years budget proposal drops that request with no explanation as to why that money is no longer necessary. \r\n Reminder: The White House Council of Economic Advisers has previously stated\u00a0the opioid epidemic has cost the U.S. $504 billion\u00a0in economic losses.\u00a0 \r\n Congress has consistently rejected proposals to dismantle ONDCP and lawmakers have argued that moving major grant programs like the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) and the Drug Free Communities\u00a0grants to DOJ and the\u00a0Health and Human Services Department would deprioritize them. \r\n Trump's latest drug czar, Jim Carroll, told lawmakers last year during his confirmation hearing\u00a0that he would have pounded on the table to keep HIDTA at ONDCP.\u00a0 \r\n Last week, however, Carroll declined to say whether he still supports keeping HIDTA and DFC under the office, Politico's Brianna Ehley reports.\u00a0 \r\n Once again, Team Trump has proven they only care whether people *think* they're trying to end the opioid crisis, a former government official who worked on the opioids' issue under Trump told Power Up.\u00a0It's a real letdown for the people who were counting on President Trump to actually help people struggling with opioid addiction. \r\n This is the administration once again articulating its skewed priorities on manufactured crises like border security and defense at the expense of real ones like overdose and the spread of infectious disease,\" Leo Beletsky,\u00a0an associate professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University, told us.\u00a0 \r\n Nothing in the Presidents budget would threaten the proven, effective counter-drug programs ONDCP oversees,\" ONDCP spokesperson Peter Hoffman told Politico's Dan Diamond. \"In fact, the overall drug control funding request is an increase of more than a billion dollars from the previous year.\" \r\n Last week during a hearing before the House Oversight Committee, Triana McNeil, the acting director of strategic issues at the Government Accountability Office, told Congress that the ONDCP's National Drug Control Strategy released in January is completely void of any performance measurement system and lacked accountability.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n There is both a leadership vacuum and a competence vacuum at the head of ONDCP, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told Carroll at the hearing.\u00a0 \r\n Carroll also acknowledged \"there wasn't really that much money associated with the declaration\" a national emergency on opioids,\u00a0but it was meant to ensure \"Americans understood what we're facing.\" \r\n Republicans, meanwhile,\u00a0used the opportunity to argue passionately for President Trump's national emergency declaration to build a border wall, according to my colleague Paige Winfield Cunningham.\u00a0 \r\n Big: The Post is out with this morning with\u00a0an investigation\u00a0on the failure of the Obama administration to contain the fentanyl crisis. \r\n My colleagues Scott Higham, Sari Horowitz and Katie Zezima report that in May 2016, 11 public health officials urged the Obama administration to declare a national emergency to train a laser-like focus on the deadly synthetic drug. \r\n \"The administration considered the request but did not act on it,\" they write in a piece titled \"The Fentanyl Failure.\" \r\n \"The decision was one in a series of missed opportunities, oversights and half-measures by federal officials who failed to grasp how quickly fentanyl was creating another and far more fatal wave of the opioid epidemic,\" my colleagues write. \r\n \"If current trends continue, the annual death toll from fentanyl will soon approach those from guns or traffic accidents.\" \r\n #BREXITSHAMBLES CONTINUES: British lawmakers *still* haven't been able to reach agreement on how to leave the European Union. Three years after the original Brexit vote\u00a0and two weeks before the deadline for leaving the European Union\u00a0on schedule, the British parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's tweaked Brexit deal.\u00a0 \r\n Last-minute negotiations with the E.U. were not enough to secure the support of hard-liners in the prime ministers own Conservative Party 75 Tories voted against their leader, my colleagues across the pond, William Booth and Karla Adam, report.\u00a0 \r\n Next steps:\u00a0Parliament will vote Wednesday on whether to leave the E.U. on schedule, on March 29, without a deal a scenario that could create economic havoc for Britain and, to lesser degree, Europe. \r\n Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer and the former British foreign secretary, continued to push for a no-deal Brexit calling it the only safe path to self-respect. Lawmakers are still seeking\u00a0a managed withdrawal, per Booth and Adam. However, both May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, appeared to have reached their limits on negotiations.\u00a0 \r\n There will be no new negotiations, Juncker told reporters after meeting with May in Strasbourg on Monday nightm signaling the E.U. was done with talks. \r\n I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight, May said, addressing parliament after Tuesday's vote. Let me be clear: Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The E.U. will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension and this House will have to answer that question, she added.\u00a0 \r\n Key: Anti-Brexit lawmakers hope that if Britains departure is delayed, momentum will build for a second referendum a do-over to ask voters whether they really want to leave.\u00a0Although Labour has endorsed a second referendum,\u00a0there does not appear to be majority support for it in Parliament, Booth and Adam report.\u00a0 \r\n So, what happens to May? Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that May had run down the clock and that he deal was dead. and Conservative political Charles Walker told the BBC that he believed there would be a general election within a matter of days or weeks if May's deal was rejected.\u00a0 \r\n What's the hold up?: Much of the dissent and last-minute wrangling over Mrs May's deal revolved around the so-called backstop. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border physical checks or infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, per the BBC. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. The UK and the Republic of Ireland are both part of the EU single market and customs union, so products don't need to be inspected for customs and standards.\u00a0If the UK leaves, that changes. \r\n UK PM Theresa May says MPs now face \"an unenviable choice\" of what to do next, stressing that \"voting against the deal and for an extension does not solve the problem\"#BrexitVote latest: https://t.co/B1iEVm5bdmpic.twitter.com/MKfBMfiO1Q \r\n Boeing crash fallout: What grounded planes mean for air travel https://t.co/keuTDyzbKEpic.twitter.com/RNNtzIdCn6 \r\n \"UNCONSCIONABLE: The Federal Aviation Administration\u00a0announced last night that the Boeing 737 Max 8 can continue to fly, even as at least 10 other countries around the world have grounded the plane that has killed over 300 people. \r\n Thus far, our review shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft, FAA Administrator Daniel Elwell said in a statement.\u00a0Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action. \r\n An investigation by the Dallas Morning News, however, begs to differ.\u00a0 \r\n Pilots repeatedly voiced safety concerns about the Boeing 737 Max 8 to federal authorities, with one captain calling the flight manual 'inadequate and almost criminally insufficient'\u00a0several months before Sunday's Ethiopian Air crash that killed 157 people,\"\u00a0 Cary Aspinwall, Ariana Giorgi and Dom DiFurio\u00a0report.\u00a0The News\u00a0found at least five\u00a0complaints about the Boeing model in a federal database where pilots can voluntarily report about aviation incidents without fear of repercussions. \r\n The disclosures found by\u00a0The News\u00a0reference problems\u00a0during\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 8 flights\u00a0with an autopilot system, and they were all\u00a0during takeoff and nose-down situations while trying to gain altitude. While records show these flights occurred during October and November, the information about which airlines the pilots were flying for is redacted from the database. \r\n Records show a captain who flies the Max 8 complained in November that it was 'unconscionable'\u00a0that the company and federal authorities allowed pilots to fly the planes without adequate training or fully disclosing information about how its systems were different from other planes, they report.\u00a0 \r\n Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the @FAANews should ground the 737 MAX 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the planes airworthiness. \r\n BOEING'S INFLUENCE:\u00a0Democratic and Republican lawmakers including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) urged Boeing to follow the world's lead and ground the\u00a0737 Max 8. \r\n The president, a self-proclaimed expert in aviation who counts a former Boeing executive as a member of his cabinet, tweeted following the crash in Ethiopia\u00a0that \"Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly\" and that he wanted\u00a0\"great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane,\" perhaps hinting at\u00a0\"where Trump might stand as the U.S. government faces pressure to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane,\" writes my colleague Toluse Olorunnipa.\u00a0 \r\n Other senators calling for the aerospace giant to stop flying the planes: Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\u00a0and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\u00a0 \r\n Further investigation may reveal that mechanical issues were not the cause, but until that time, our first priority must be the safety of the flying public, Cruz told Politico's Melanie Zanona and Brianna Gurciullo. \r\n Warren, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, also called on Congress to hold hearings and noted that the Boeing 737 Max 'is a major driver of Boeing profits, reported The Post's John Wagner.\u00a0 \r\n Zinger:\u00a0In the coming weeks and months, Congress should hold hearings on whether an Administration that famously refused to stand up to Saudi Arabia to protect Boeing arms sales has once again put lives at risk for the same reason, Warren said. \r\n Boeing is a major player in Washington with a direct line into the president\u00a0 they\u00a0spent $15 million on lobbying efforts in D.C. last year: \r\n Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg\u00a0has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, although it has sometimes been uneasy,\" the New York Times reports. Muilenburg\u00a0visited Trump in Mar-a-Lago after he criticized Boeing for the cost of building new Air Force One planes.\u00a0 \r\n It was a terrific conversation,' Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump 'my personal commitment' that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate.\u00a0 \r\n Weeks after the conversation, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trumps inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help finance President Barack Obamas inauguration in 2013.\u00a0 \r\n Home court advantage: The individual lawmaker\u00a0receiving the most from Boeing in the 2018 cycle was Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington state, who collected $54,000. \r\n Ranking second among individuals was then-Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) with $48,000 and placing third was\u00a0Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) with $38,000. \r\n Lobbying:Boeing's lobbying investment dipped slightly in 2018 compared to previous years. The company spent $15 million on persuasion campaigns last year compared to $16.7 million in 2017; $17 million in 2016 and a recent high of $22 million in 2015. \r\n FaceTime: Receiving the most amount of Boeing's lobbying largesse\u00a0in 2018 was Norm Dicks & Assoc., headed by ex-Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), a longtime House Appropriations panel member and former chair of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. \r\n Kicker: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao appears fine with the Max, having flown on the plane back from Austin on Tuesday. \r\n \"Operation Varsity Blues\": A biopic I would watch: \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Full House\" intersect at the center of an allegedly widespread multimillion dollar bribery scheme -- the largest ever college admissions scam\u00a0-- that allowed underperforming kids from wealthy families entrance to prestigious universities.

It has reported a loss for three quarters in a row, while analysts have cut their ratings. The stock now trades for less than a dollar -- down from nearly $50 in 1998. \r\n In the past two years, Rite Aid has seen multiple mergers fall through, leaving an uncertain future for the company with no clear end game. In 2017, a proposed tie-up with Walgreens fell apart amid antitrust scrutiny by U.S. regulators. In August 2018, another proposed merger, with supermarket chain Albertsons Cos., was called off after two prominent proxy advisers recommended that shareholders vote against it. \r\n \u201cThese are dark times for Rite Aid shareholders,\u201d said Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI. \u201cGiven the elevated leverage levels and likely declining profit line, we think the outlook here is pretty dire.\u201d \r\n In a statement after the announcement, Rite Aid spokesman Chris Savarese said that the changes aim at \u201cmore closely aligning the structure and leadership of the company with the scale of its operations.\u201d The departures \u201care not at all a result of any wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \r\n The job cuts will eliminate about 20 percent of the corporate positions at the company\u2019s Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, headquarters and elsewhere.

If Facebook succeeds in turning its own messaging services into a platform for everything, it could ultimately threaten established services such as Snapchat, Yelp, Venmo, eBay and even Apple and Amazon. \r\n Its clear that Facebook does have very broad ambitions here, said Bob ODonnell, president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research. Their goal is to be the WeChat of everywhere but China. \r\n But Facebook faces numerous hurdles. A key one is restoring user trust, following a string of privacy failures that include the sharing of personal information from as many as 87 million users with a consulting firm affiliated with Donald Trumps campaign. And any change may cause users to rethink their relationship with Facebook. \r\n Facebook has a lot of momentum but its not completely invincible, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. People came to Facebook for a particular thing. Offer them a different thing, and theyre likely to re-evaluate whether they want to be there at all. \r\n After all, Friendster and Myspace came and went as Facebook grew. Yahoo and AltaVista moved over for Google. And remember when AOL was popular, powerful and rich enough to buy the traditional media company Time Warner? Both AOL and Yahoo are now fading brands within Verizon. \r\n This involves scrambling all messages in WhatsApp, Instagram Direct and Messenger so that even Facebook itself cant read them. Facebook will also let messages automatically disappear after a set amount of time, something rival Snapchat already does. \r\n Facebook, Zuckerberg said, will then build more ways for people to interact on top of that, including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services. \r\n Facebook declined to further elaborate on its ambitions, and a spokeswoman reinforced that it is early in the process. But there are clues in what Chinese tech giant Tencent has already done with WeChat in China. WeChat combines functions that are typically done by separate companies elsewhere think of Facebook and its messaging services combined with PayPal and Uber. People use WeChat to buy goods in retail stores, split restaurant bills with friends, pay utility bills, donate to charities and hail rides from the Uber-like Didi Chuxing service. \r\n Facebook already lets people send money to other individuals through Messenger in the U.S. and a few other countries and is testing payments through WhatsApp in India. The New York Times reported that Facebook is also developing its own digital currency to make it easier for users to send money to their messaging contacts. \r\n Facebook didnt offer many details on its digital currency endeavors, but said a new small team was looking for ways to make use of the type of technology powering bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. \r\n While the current payment options require linking Facebook to bank accounts or services such as PayPal, a digital currency could potentially work without them. That could appeal to users, especially in Asia and Africa, with limited access to banking services, said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in security and payments. \r\n And it would solve a key challenge with commerce on phones. Litan said entering credit card details on a phone is cumbersome, and businesses often lose customers before they complete orders. If Facebook can integrate payments into messaging, it can keep users within Facebook and convince advertisers theyre more likely to complete sales. \r\n Facebook could also diversify revenue beyond advertising. For instance, it could take a commission, whether for newspaper subscriptions or food deliveries, much as Apple already does with a cut of up to 30 percent for app payments. \r\n Kay said messaging could become one-stop shop for Yelp-like business reviews, OpenTable restaurant reservations, on-demand delivery similar to Uber and a marketplace akin to eBay the latter being something Facebook already offers on its main app. Amazon might be tougher to challenge, he said, given the companys expertise in delivery logistics, but there might be pieces such as grocery delivery that Facebook can go after. \r\n Nonetheless, potential Facebook rivals need not pack up yet.

If Facebook succeeds in turning its own messaging services into a platform for everything, it could ultimately threaten established services such as Snapchat, Yelp, Venmo, eBay and even Apple and Amazon. \r\n \"It's clear that Facebook does have very broad ambitions here,\" said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"Their goal is to be the WeChat of everywhere but China.\" \r\n But Facebook faces numerous hurdles. A key one is restoring user trust, following a string of privacy failures that include the sharing of personal information from as many as 87 million users with a consulting firm affiliated with Donald Trump's campaign. And any change may cause users to rethink their relationship with Facebook. \r\n \"Facebook has a lot of momentum but it's not completely invincible,\" said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. \"People came to Facebook for a particular thing. Offer them a different thing, and they're likely to re-evaluate whether they want to be there at all.\" \r\n After all, Friendster and Myspace came and went as Facebook grew. Yahoo and AltaVista moved over for Google. And remember when AOL was popular, powerful and rich enough to buy the traditional media company Time Warner? Both AOL and Yahoo are now fading brands within Verizon. \r\n This involves scrambling all messages in WhatsApp, Instagram Direct and Messenger so that even Facebook itself can't read them. Facebook will also let messages automatically disappear after a set amount of time, something rival Snapchat already does. \r\n Facebook, Zuckerberg said, will \"then build more ways for people to interact on top of that, including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services.\" \r\n Facebook declined to further elaborate on its ambitions, and a spokeswoman reinforced that it is early in the process. But there are clues in what Chinese tech giant Tencent has already done with WeChat in China. WeChat combines functions that are typically done by separate companies elsewhere think of Facebook and its messaging services combined with PayPal and Uber. People use WeChat to buy goods in retail stores, split restaurant bills with friends, pay utility bills, donate to charities and hail rides from the Uber-like Didi Chuxing service. \r\n Facebook already lets people send money to other individuals through Messenger in the U.S. and a few other countries and is testing payments through WhatsApp in India. The New York Times reported that Facebook is also developing its own digital currency to make it easier for users to send money to their messaging contacts. \r\n Facebook didn't offer many details on its digital currency endeavors, but said a \"new small team\" was looking for ways to make use of the type of technology powering bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. \r\n While the current payment options require linking Facebook to bank accounts or services such as PayPal, a digital currency could potentially work without them. That could appeal to users, especially in Asia and Africa, with limited access to banking services, said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in security and payments. \r\n And it would solve a key challenge with commerce on phones. Litan said entering credit card details on a phone is cumbersome, and businesses often lose customers before they complete orders. If Facebook can integrate payments into messaging, it can keep users within Facebook and convince advertisers they're more likely to complete sales. \r\n Facebook could also diversify revenue beyond advertising. For instance, it could take a commission, whether for newspaper subscriptions or food deliveries, much as Apple already does with a cut of up to 30 percent for app payments. \r\n Kay said messaging could become one-stop shop for Yelp-like business reviews, OpenTable restaurant reservations, on-demand delivery similar to Uber and a marketplace akin to eBay the latter being something Facebook already offers on its main app. Amazon might be tougher to challenge, he said, given the company's expertise in delivery logistics, but there might be pieces such as grocery delivery that Facebook can go after. \r\n Nonetheless, potential Facebook rivals need not pack up yet. Zuckerberg's blog read as a manifesto, a list of things he wants to implement, and it's unclear how much will actually get executed, eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. She said it's too soon for competitors to start drastically adapting. \r\n There also might be room for Facebook to sit alongside existing services.

Six quotes that came out on Monday, from a range of sources, could be grouped together and put into a time capsule to help future historians make sense of American politics circa 2019. \r\n -- The first is a little-noticed paragraph inside the 150-page budget request that President Trump submitted to Congress on Monday: Even with high levels of economic growth, excessive deficits continue to threaten the Nations progress, and any unforeseen shocks to the economy could make deficits unsustainable, it says. If financial obligations continue to grow at the current pace, the Nations creditors may demand higher interest rates to compensate, potentially leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock, harming both American businesses and workers. \r\n The document warns that deficits are on track to remain over a trillion dollars per year for the foreseeable future, the national debt now $22 trillion will soon surpass a percent of GDP not seen since 1947, and interest payments alone on the federal governments debt will double by 2023 and exceed spending on the U.S. military by 2024 if nothing is done. \r\n The White House projects that the government will need to spend $482 billion on interest payments for the debt next year alone. Thats more than the entire budget for Medicaid. \r\n Whats remarkable is that there is no evidence of meaningful political will to tackle this potentially existential crisis. Leaders in both parties called the budget dead on arrival. \r\n Although the budget proposes the most spending reductions ever sent to Congress, as one of Trumps top aides put it, the deficit is expected to hit $1.1 trillion this year and stay above the trillion mark every year through at least 2022, economics correspondent Heather Long reports. This is unprecedented in good economic times and is occurring because Trump and Congress are spending more at the same time the GOP tax cuts drive down government revenue. (Trumps budget shows small increases the next few years in tax revenue, but that might be a stretch given what is occurring so far this fiscal year). \r\n What should give Americans heartburn is that even the dire numbers are based on some fantastical if not impossible assumptions, including that there will not be a recession at any point in the next decade. No president likes to predict a downturn, but Trump is being exceptionally rosy in his outlook, Heather notes. His budget predicts about 3 percent growth every year for a decade. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of slightly below 2 percent a year. To achieve Trumps projection, the economy would have to grow at A-plus potential for years with no recessions, something the United States has never achieved before. \r\n There are certainly some fiscal hawks who work inside the administration, like acting OMB director Russ Vought and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but what matters is who sits in the Oval Office. Trump has called himself the king of debt and argued privately that deficits dont really matter because they wont blow up until after he leaves office. He didnt even mention the issue during his recent State of the Union address. \r\n Theres a pattern of Republican politicians demanding fiscal responsibility when theyre in the wilderness but then spending like drunken sailors on shore leave when they hold power. Its happening again. The 2017 GOP tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the richest 1 percent of Americans and the biggest corporations, will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. With no change in trajectory, the ship of state will continue drifting down a river that ends with a waterfall. \r\n Former vice president Dick Cheney attends a memorial ceremony for George H.W. Bush at the Capitol in December. (Jonathan Ernst/AP) \r\n 2. Dick Cheney: Were getting into a situation when our friends and allies around the world that we depend upon are going to lack confidence in us. I worry that the bottom line of that kind of an approach is we have an administration that looks a lot more like Barack Obama than Ronald Reagan. \r\n The former vice president uncorked one of the most searing conservative critiques to date of Trumps foreign policy while conducting a Q&A with Vice President Pence at a donor retreat this weekend sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. Someone leaked a transcript yesterday of the off-the-record session on Sea Island, Ga. \r\n Cheney respectfully but repeatedly and firmly pressed Pence on a number of the presidents foreign policy moves, Ashley Parker and Bob Costa report. He expressed concerns at such actions as taking a harder line toward U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deciding to withdraw troops from Syria during what he fretted was the middle of a phone call. Cheney expressed alarm over news reports that Trump supposedly doesnt spend that much time with the intel people, or doesnt agree with them, frequently, as well as the high staff turnover rate at the intelligence agencies. \r\n He worried aloud, again and again, that for Trump, foreign policy boils down to a crude dollars-and-cents transaction. He worried about Trumps decision to cancel the decades-long U.S. military exercises with South Korea and referenced a recent Bloomberg News report about the presidents directive to pursue a policy that would insist that the Germans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans pay total cost for our deployments there, plus 50 percent on top of that. I dont know, that sounded like a New York state real estate deal to me, Cheney quipped. \r\n Pence, unprepared for tough questions, mostly shrugged off Cheneys concerns and praised Trump as a transformational leader. Reading the transcript shows what a total loyalist Pence has become to Trump. He staked out several positions that are at odds with the posture he took as a congressman and governor. \r\n Moreover, the conversation between the two men who have held the No. 2 job underscored the deep fissures that remain inside the GOP over Trumps foreign policy. Its the same tension that led to Jim Mattiss resignation in December as defense secretary after Trump abruptly announced the complete withdrawal of troops from Syria. The president eventually relented under pressure from hawks on the Hill. Some troops will stay. \r\n 3. Nancy Pelosi: Im not for impeachment. Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless theres something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I dont think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And hes just not worth it. \r\n The California Democrat said this knowing that shed take instant and intense heat from her left flank, which she has, but her goal appears to be protecting vulnerable moderate members who are up for reelection next year in districts that Trump carried. Pelosi saw firsthand what happened to Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Shes realistic that the Republican-controlled Senate wouldnt convict Trump to remove him from office if Democrats acted unilaterally, and she gave herself an out to change her mind if something new emerges.\u00a0 \r\n Many Democratic strategists believe that impeachment would give Trump a useful foil and get recalcitrant Republicans to rally behind him for 2020, barring big new bombshells from the investigations by special counsel Bob Mueller or newly empowered congressional committees. Pelosi is one of the shrewdest tacticians in modern political history, and she appears to be playing a long game of trying to increase her partys odds of keeping its majority. \r\n While liberal firebrands have won an outsize share of media coverage, the House Democratic majority was captured largely because of freshmen who ran to the center, said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and many of them are uncomfortable with impeachment talk, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report. \r\n Weve got 31 Democrats who serve in districts that Donald Trump won, and Im one of them, Bustos said. When I go home, I dont have people asking me about impeaching him. That is just not something that I hear. They consistently ask about health care and rebuilding our country and figuring out how to work together. \r\n President Trump celebrates the passage of the GOP tax cuts in December 2017 with Paul Ryan. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \r\n 4. Paul Ryan on 2020: The person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isnt going to win it. \r\n The former speaker of the House reportedly said during a speech last night in Vero Beach, Fla., that there are some Democrats who could beat Trump and the president must make the race about his policies, not his personal brand, if hes going to prevail. \r\n Ryan said one of the Houses biggest mistakes during his tenure was taking too long to negotiate a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Ali Schmitz reports for Treasure Coast Newspapers. Ryan blamed the right-leaning flank of the party, including the Freedom Caucus, for causing a three-month delay in moving the legislation through the House. That three-month delay eroded public support for it, so by the time it got over to the Senate, it was hanging on a thread, Ryan said. Ryan said if there werent delays in moving it through the House, he would have expected it to pass the Senate. \r\n The 2012 GOP nominee for vice president said technology has created an outrage machine, according to the story: He said people are monetizing emotions, causing entertainment wings of each party that focus on emotional responses rather than focusing on the merits of their policies. \r\n 5. Tucker Carlson: [W]e will never bow to the mob ever. No matter what. \r\n Ryan didnt mention Carlson, but theres no doubt that the former House speaker was talking about people like him when he lamented the entertainment wing of the GOP and the way it is monetizing emotions. \r\n Carlson also spoke crassly of immigrants and questioned Barack Obamas identity as a black man. How is he black, for one thing? He has one white parent, one black parent, he said in 2006. Two years later, he added, I dont know how black he is, but Im sure hes a good basketball player he says he is, anyway. \r\n Carlson went on the air about the same time the second video was released and said his critics werent motivated by genuine concern. He said theyre trying to silence him. Carlson praised the network for having his back even after the revelations. \r\n We live in an era of conservative counterpunchers. Tellingly, Donald Trump Jr. praised Carlson for refusing to apologize: \r\n  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 11, 2019 \r\n 6. Donald Trump: The Democrats hate Jewish people. \r\n During her first news conference in more than 40 days, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly declined to answer yesterday whether Trump truly believes Democrats hate Jewish people. \r\n In this case, its the president saying that the opposition party hates an entire faith of people and his press secretary not even trying to walk it back. The fact that it barely moves the needle shows how normalized over-the-top rhetoric, and questioning peoples motives, has become in the Trump era. \r\n The numbers dont bear out Trumps claims. Thirty-two of the 34 Jewish members of Congress are Democrats. According to the Pew Research Center, more than 70 percent of Jewish Americans voted for [Hillary Clinton] in the 2016 presidential election, Eugene Scott notes. An October 2018 poll found that 74 percent of Jews planned to vote for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. Three quarters of respondents disapproved of the presidents policies. The president has developed close ties with Israel, and in particular [Bibi Netanyahu], but being pro-Israel and being the party of American Jews is not the same thing. \r\n -- Britain just banned the Boeing 737 Max from its airspace after China, Australia and other nations grounded the jets in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia. Gerry Shih reports:When China became the first country on Monday to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, its aviation regulator sent an unmistakable signal: the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is no longer the only authority in civil aviation worldwide. Chinas move, which was unprecedented for a government that once took cues from the FAA, was motivated by what Chinese officials and pilots said was months of equivocation from U.S. officials and Boeing in response to safety inquiries from China after the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last October.  \r\n After China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes roughly a quarter of all 737 Max in operation globally authorities in Ethiopia, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco and Mongolia quickly followed suit, as did carriers in Latin America and South Korea. Despite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jets airworthiness, Britain, Australia, Malaysia and Oman became the latest countries to ground the model a day later, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation. \r\n The U.S. embassy in Caracas.

(Cathy Free) \r\n -- Nancy Pelosi promised that the House will reject Trumps budget, and even many congressional Republicans criticized various elements of the proposal. Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report: And the demand for $8.6 billion for a border wall, less than two months after a 35-day shutdown paralyzed much of Washington, raised the possibility that there could be an even more dramatic impasse if a spending deal isnt reached by the end of September. Top White House officials acknowledged that lawmakers routinely dismiss these budget proposals, but they signaled a willingness on Monday to fight harder this year than they have in the past. Trumps GOP allies, meanwhile, received the budget plan with a lukewarm embrace. The defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps. \r\n -- Trumps proposal to cut Medicare spending by $845 billion over the next 10 years, despite his campaign promises to protect the popular program, will encounter some of the strongest resistance.\u00a0From Jeff Stein and Amy Goldstein: Most of the trims relate to changing payments to doctors and hospitals\u00a0 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Social Security, the retirement program for the elderly, but his budget last year also included a proposed cut of more than $550 billion to the program. \r\n -- Medicare-for-all v.

Politico's Dan Diamond reports: Nicklaus had lobbied Trump on the golf course in Florida, and he met with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in Washington, D.C., to request funds, say two individuals with knowledge. Trump personally directed HHS to earmark the funds to help Nicklaus develop mobile children's hospitals, one individual said.\u00a0 \r\n -- Trumps budget proposal would hit Americas poor the hardest,\u00a0slashing billions of dollars in food stamps, health insurance and federal housing subsidies while pushing legislation to institute broad work requirements for families receiving housing vouchers, expanding on moves by some states to require recipients of Medicaid and food stamps to work,\u00a0Caitlin Dewey, Tracy Jan and Jeff Stein report. \r\n It would gut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, by $17.2 billion and would redesign the entire program, using a portion of SNAP benefit money to buy and deliver a monthly food box. Eaters Whitney Filloon writes the proposal claims the box would significantly reduc[e] the cost to taxpayers, but provides no information on how shipping a box of government-selected canned goods to millions of people would be at all cost-saving. \r\n It would slash the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget by 14 percent,\u00a0eliminating the entire fund for public housing capital repairs. Trump called for cutting a federal housing subsidy program that experts estimate would result in more than a quarter-million low-income families losing\u00a0assistance. \r\n -- The budget would slash $8.5 billion from the Department of Education. Moriah Balingit and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel report: Trumps budget request again seeks to cut popular programs, including one that supports after-school activities for children in impoverished communities and another that offers wide-ranging grants that underwrite textbooks, equipment, counseling services and other needs for schools. That pool of money the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program also underwrites school safety efforts, including mental-health services and school safety equipment. \r\n -- The budget would also make federal workers pay more toward their retirement benefits until the employee and government share is equal. Eric Yoder reports: For most employees that would mean an increase of about six percentage points, which would be phased in as one percentage point more per year. The government share would decrease on the same schedule. Also under the proposal, for employees retiring after an unspecified date, annuity benefits would be based on the highest five consecutive salary years rather than the currently used 'high-3.'\u00a0Further, it would end a supplemental benefit paid to many employees who retire before age 62, when they become eligible for Social Security.\u00a0 \r\n -- House Dems are likely to skip a vote on a budget this year to avoid what could be an embarrassing intraparty battle. Though publicly many Democrats have said they want a chance to vote on their partys fiscal blueprint, privately theyre saying that a budget is unlikely to come to a vote given the multiple divisions within the caucus. (Politico) \r\n House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) wants to interview two lawyers in connection to Trump's ethical and financial disclosures. (Alex Brandon/AP) \r\n -- New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four Trump Organization projects, as well as Trump's failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills. Michael Cohen testified during last month's hearing that Trump inflated his assets in financial statements, and Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank. The inquiry by Ms. Jamess office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear,\u00a0the Timess William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim report. \r\n -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)\u00a0is seeking\u00a0testimony from\u00a0two lawyers responsible for Trumps ethical and financial disclosures. But the White House is blocking him from talking to a potentially key witness. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown report: White House Counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of making 'grossly unfair' allegations against Stefan Passantino and Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon both of whom Cummings wants to interview and damaging their reputations. Last month, Cummings sent a letter to Cipollone that stated the committee has obtained new documents showing Passantino and Dillon 'may have provided false information' when they were questioned by federal ethics officials about hush money payments paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. ...\u00a0In response, Cipollone chided Cummings for directly requesting an interview with Passantino, instead of going through the White House counsel's office, and said the White House would not make Passantino available. \r\n -- Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will return to Capitol Hill tomorrow for a private meeting with the House Judiciary Committee. Karoun Demirjian reports: In a letter to Whitaker after his testimony, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said members of the panel found Whitakers answers unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence, stressing that they wanted to meet with him again so he could elaborate on his testimony. Nadler questioned Whitakers testimony indicating that he never discussed Trumps frustration with Michael Cohen. \r\n -- The Senate Intelligence Committee spoke privately to Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, who is married to former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Karoun Demirjian reports: The panel asked Mangiante Papadopoulos about her former employer Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor with suspected ties to the Kremlin ... Mifsud, prosecutors have said, offered to help her husband ... broker meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials Mangiante Papadopoulos said congressional investigators were more focused on her experience working with Mifsud than what she knew of her husbands activities during the campaign. \r\n -- Attorneys for Roger Stone apologized in a new filing last night for misrepresenting to a federal judge plans about his new book criticizing Bob Mueller. But they said it was an unintentional mistake\u00a0and the court can still seat an impartial jury.\u00a0Spencer S. Hsu reports: Attorneys for the Republican operative and longtime friend of President Trump acknowledge that the gaffe could land Stone in jail if the judge finds he violated a gag order in his case barring him from feeding prejudicial pretrial publicity. But they denied using an erroneous March 1 filing notifying the court of the 'imminent release' of the book after the judge imposed the gag order Feb. 21 to build publicity for the work, 'The Myth of Russian Collusion,' a retitled version of his earlier book about Trumps 2016 campaign, with a new introduction. 'There was/is no intention to hide anything,'\u00a0wrote Stones attorneys. \r\n -- The same federal judge overseeing Stones criminal case, Amy Berman Jackson, will decide tomorrow whether to add prison time to Manaforts sentence. Spencer reports: The looming question Wednesday is whether any prison time Jackson might impose will overlap or be tacked on to the 47-month term Manafort received last week from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria. In overseeing the Manafort case and the separate case of [Stone], Jackson has given a master class in how to try high-profile cases, some colleagues on the bench said, by relying on preparation, discretion and a refusal to get drawn into side disputes. \r\n -- For what it's worth, the special counsel's effort is fully funded through the end of September. After that, Mueller can request funding for the next fiscal year by the end of June.\u00a0(Reuters) \r\n Officials examine contains\u00a03,200 pounds of cocaine seized at the Port of New York\u00a0in Newark\u00a0by Customs and Border Protection. (U.S. Customs and Border Protection/AP) \r\n -- A major cocaine bust highlights\u00a0an inconvenient truth for Trump and his immigration policies: The vast majority of drugs come through legal ports of entry.\u00a0Eli Rosenberg writes:\u00a0Despite Trumps claims, experts say the majority of drugs come into the United States through legal ports of entry not illegal crossings. Customs and Border Protection announced that a task force drawn from six law enforcement organizations had seized 3,200 pounds of cocaine a street value of $77 million on Feb. 28, not from some dusty overland trail in Texas, but from a shipping container that arrived at the port in Newark. It was the largest cocaine seizure at the port in nearly 25 years. \r\n -- More than 2,000 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have been quarantined amid an outbreak of mumps and other contagious diseases. From CNNs Geneva Sands, Michelle Lou and Susan Scutti: As of March 7, 2019, there was a total of 2,287 detainees cohorted for exposure to a detainee with a contagious condition, said ICE spokesperson Brendan Raedy in a statement. In the past 12 months, there have been health investigations at 51 ICE detention facilities for mumps, chickenpox and influenza, according to Raedy. There have been 236 reported cases of mumps, with another 16 suspected cases during this time period. It was unclear Monday, if ICE was taking additional steps to deal with issues of disease in its facilities. \r\n -- Top officials at a troubled Texas charity for migrants resigned following months of investigations into allegations of mismanagement and malfeasance.\u00a0The Times's Nicholas Kulish, Kim Barker and Rebecca R. Ruiz report: For months, Juan Sanchez was at the center of the national uproar over family separations at the Mexican border because the nonprofit he founded, Southwest Key Programs, was housing migrant children taken from their parents. On Monday, facing intense scrutiny from his own organization and federal investigations over alleged financial improprieties, he stepped down after 32 years at the helm. ...\u00a0The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Tex., known as Casa Padre, became a symbol of the Trump administrations family separation policy, with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children. But it was also a generator of millions of dollars in federal grants at a nonprofit unusually concerned with its bottom line. ...\u00a0Mr. Sanchez earned $1.5 million in 2017, the most recent tax return available. His wife earned $500,000. His daughter from a previous marriage also held a senior position, but her salary was not available. Ms. Chung earned $1 million.\u00a0 \r\n -- The Customs and Border Protection agency plans to implement a biometric entry-exit system\u00a0using\u00a0facial recognition technology on more than 100 million travelers flying out of the United States. BuzzFeed News's Davey Alba reports\u00a0on\u00a0documents obtained by the nonprofit research organization Electronic Privacy Information Center: These same documents state explicitly that there were no limits on how partnering airlines can use this facial recognition data. CBP did not answer specific questions about whether there are any guidelines for how other technology companies involved in processing the data can potentially also use it. ... CBP did not explain what its current policies around data sharing of biometric information with participating companies and third-party firms are, but it did say thatthe agency 'retains photos for up to 14 days' of non-US citizens departing the country, for 'evaluation of the technology' and 'assurance of the accuracy of the algorithms'\u00a0 which implies such photos might be used for further training of its facial matching AI.\u00a0 \r\n Facial recognition technology is already at use in 17 international airports, including\u00a0New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Houston. Major airlines including Delta, American Airlines and British Airways support the usage of this technology. \r\n -- The apparel manufacturing, taxi and limousine services, as well as\u00a0nail salons and personal care industries depend the most on immigrant labor, according to a new report by the New American Economy group. In New York, 80 percent of limo and taxi drivers are immigrants while in California, more than 75 percent of agriculture workers are immigrants. (Axios)\u00a0 \r\n -- British\u00a0lawmakers will determine this week whether to delay Britains departure from the European Union. William Booth and Karla Adam report: On Tuesday, British lawmakers are scheduled to vote again on [Prime Minister Theresa]\u00a0Mays withdrawal agreement, along with the supplemental statements. A possible series of votes this week will help determine whether Britain will depart on schedule on March 29 or whether there will be more uncertainty, division and delay. \r\n -- Pelosi and Mitch McConnell extended a rare bipartisan invitation to NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to address a joint session of Congress next month. Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Robert Costa report: NATO declined to say whether Stoltenberg would accept the invitation, saying that his schedule during his Washington trip in April will be announced in due course. The invitation could put the NATO leader in a slightly awkward position. Stoltenberg has gone to great lengths to foster a positive relationship with Trump. If the congressional invitation were seen as too direct a rebuke to the White House, it could suck him into a domestic U.S. political battle he has been eager to avoid. \r\n -- The Trump administration threatened to scale back its intelligence sharing with Germany if Berlin allows\u00a0the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to participate in the countrys development of a 5G network.The Wall Street Journals Bojan Pancevski and Sara Germano report: The threat marks the first time the U.S. has explicitly warned an ally that refusing to ostracize Huawei could lessen security cooperation with Washington. Both German and U.S. officials said the threat from Washington will unsettle Germanys security community, which is a big consumer of intelligence provided by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. information gatherers. \r\n -- The Trump administration has taken a harder-line approach to denuclearizing North Korea since the president's failed second summit with Kim Jong Un last month.\u00a0John Hudson reports: In remarks Monday, a top U.S. envoy said the United States would not lift sanctions on North Korea until it completely dismantles its nuclear and ballistic missiles. The United States is also seeking an end to Pyongyangs chemical and biological weapons, he said. Confronted with North Koreas insistence on major sanctions relief at the summit, the United States made a counterproposal demanding full sanctions relief for full denuclearization, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. \r\n -- Syrian government forces have frequently subjected male prisoners to sexual violence. Louisa Loveluck reports: According to a report released Monday by Lawyers and Doctors for Human Rights, a Syrian rights group, security forces have used rape and enforced sterilization, as well as the tying, burning and mutilation of mens genitals, to force confessions and submission. \r\n Kirsten Gillibrand worships at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina last month. (Meg Kinnard/AP) \r\n -- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) continues\u00a0to defend her office's investigation into sexual harassment claims made by a former aide. She said she has no regrets about the way it was handled and she has not spoken with the woman who made the claims\u00a0since she left her staff last summer. (Felicia Sonmez) \r\n -- Beto ORourke is expected to launch his presidential campaign very soon, even though he has not really prepared in the traditional way. The New York Timess Matt Flegenheimer and Lisa Lerer report: There has been no flirtation tour in Iowa, no trip to New Hampshire since his college years as an Ivy League rower. Mr. ORourke had no traditional campaign-in-waiting at the ready after the midterms Few doubt Mr. ORourkes capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fundraising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like [Biden and Sanders]. But perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as Mr. ORourke, and his drawn-out non-candidacy has provided few answers.\u00a0ORourke announced in a Twitter video that he would make his first visit to Iowa this weekend. \r\n -- Stacey Abrams, who also lost the Georgia gubernatorial\u00a0race last year, said\u00a0she could run for president in 2020\u00a0after saying previously that 2028 would be the earliest race she'd consider.\u00a0(CNN) \r\n -- Under fire, Facebook quickly reversed its decision to pull ads by Sen. Elizabeth Warrens campaign calling for the breakup of the social media giant. Politicos Cristiano Lima reports: The ads, which had identical images and text, touted Warren's recently announced plan to unwind anti-competitive tech mergers, including Facebooks acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. A message on the three ads said: This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook's advertising policies. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the ads had been taken down but said the company is in the process of restoring them. \r\n -- Related: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the agency of allowing Facebook and other tech giants to mishandle consumers private data. Tony Romm reports: Hawley said there is substantial evidence that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. \r\n -- Court packing is gaining currency among far-left activists, who in turn are trying to prod presidential candidates to embrace it.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who recently decided against running for president, became the latest figure to embrace an expansion of the nine-member court in recent talks at Yale Law School and Columbia University. [South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg] has also discussed a 15-justice structure for the court five Democratic appointees, five Republican appointees and five chosen by the other 10. The concept of expanding the Supreme Court, like the phrase court packing itself, fell into lengthy disrepute after 1937, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ... sought to add six friendlier justices, prompting an outcry even from allies.\u00a0 \r\n -- The strong showings of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the latest Iowa poll are impressive but shouldnt be overemphasized, Dan Balz writes: The poll should be read in two ways as a sign of initial strength for each of them, and as an indication of the vulnerabilities the two best-known figures in the race could face. With a big field assembling, those numbers Biden at 27 percent and Sanders at 25 percent are helpful but not overwhelmingly impressive. At every candidate event this year, there are more shoppers than buyers, and any number of candidates are drawing crowds and good reviews. Other candidates are and will have their moments. Still, it is notable that Biden and Sanders are where they are, given who they are. \r\n -- This week, Biden will address the International Association of Firefighters and the Delaware Democratic Party, two supportive audiences that will serve as the final test drive before the former vice president makes a 2020 decision. From NBC Newss Mike Memoli: The coming week may be a point of no return for him, as aides recognize that the partys patience is wearing thin. To the extent advisers identify any potential hurdles hes still reckoning with, they are parallel: how and when to engage with attacks from the most strident partisan voices in both parties, including Trump. No final decisions have been made on what Bidens campaign platform would be, but advisers said their starting point is similar to the one he sketched out when he considered joining the 2016 race which includes: \u00a0 \r\n A tax code overhaul to treat investment income as earned income. \r\n -- Many of New York Mayor Bill de Blasios closest aides are trying to talk him out of running for president.\u00a0Politicos Laura Nahmias and Sally Goldenberg report: As de Blasio touted his liberal record in Iowa and South Carolina in recent weeks, nearly three dozen former and current aides, consultants and allies ... panned the idea or doubted that the mayor would run for the Democratic nomination. Aside from the few people working on the nascent effort, only two said de Blasio should run. \r\n -- The large Democratic\u00a0field is stressing out a very specific group of people:\u00a0pollsters. Politico's Steven Shepard reports:\u00a0New surveys are cramming up to 23 Democrats into their questionnaires after the Democratic National Committee set a low, 1 percent polling threshold to gain admittance into the partys first primary debates. The miles-long list of candidates has created an unusual set of methodological challenges for pollsters already battling declining engagement with their surveys. ...\u00a0The 2020 race presents a different problem: which candidates to include. Most pollsters are choosing to list as many candidates as possible even at the risk of flooding poll respondents with a long list of names.\u00a0 \r\n -- Maryland Gov.

The New York Timess Danny Hakim reports: Since its creation in 2016, it has adopted an increasingly apocalyptic, hard-right tone, warning of race wars, describing Barack Obama as a fresh-faced flower-child president, calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and comparing journalists to rodents. In recent weeks, in a rare airing of internal debate at the N.R.A., two prominent board members expressed concerns about NRATV. \r\n As Ive been tweeting since last year, watch for Trump to dump Pence later this year.

The FEC ordered the super PAC and the company to pay a combined $940,000 in penalties one of its largest fines to date, according to FEC records.

This is up .2% from last December's performance and 2.3% year-over-year (YoY).  \r\n These improvements are particularly important following retail's poor performance in December 2018 \u2014 when it had the biggest drop on a month-to-month basis since 2009 \u2014 as they indicate that the industry may avoid a prolonged slide.  \r\n  A number of retail segments recovered, with e-commerce coming in as one of the top performers. After growing only 2% YoY in December, nonstore retailers' sales, which includes e-commerce, rose 7.3% YoY, giving it the second highest YoY growth in January behind building material's 8.7% YoY jump.  \r\n  Other segments like food and beverage stores, health and personal care stores, and the group including sporting goods stores saw higher annual sales growth in January than in December. Having a number of areas perform well could mean that retail as a whole is trending in the right direction, but segments including furniture and apparel and clothing accessory stores saw worse YoY growth in January than they did in December, so there's still reason for concern.  \r\n  A revision of December's performance suggests that its sales growth was worse than originally thought, making January's results that much more important.The US Census Bureau originally reported that December's sales saw a 1.2% drop from November and a 2.3% increase YoY, but its newly released report puts December's month-to-month sales growth at -1.6% and its YoY growth at just 1.6%.  \r\n  This means that retailers may be hurting more than originally thought, especially those that rely on holiday sales to bolster their full-year performances.  \r\n  January could be the beginning of a positive trend in US retail in 2019 \u2014 something it desperately needs since it's off to a rough start.Retailers have already announced plans to close over 4,300 stores in 2019. Meanwhile, the year kicked off with the government shutdown and the US-China trade war is ongoing \u2014 and both impact retail's performance.  \r\n  If January is the first of many months of improved sales and consumer spending, retailers may be able to weather these issues, but if not, store closures, retail bankruptcies, and other issues could pile up throughout 2019.

Her team is probing whether Amazon uses the data it collects from businesses that sell products on its platform to inform its own product sales and undercut its competitors.\u00a0\u00a0(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.\u00a0Bezos owns The Washington Post.) \r\n Since its not given that I can continue for the commissioner for competition, I would like to take more decisive steps before I have to go, Vestager told a small group of reporters at South by Southwest. Were pushing it for obvious reasons.\u00a0 \r\n As Europe seeks to crack down on Big Tech, Vestager is especially focused on the competition issues that arise\u00a0when companies are both\u00a0marketplaces that host other sellers -- and retailers competing to peddle their own products. Vestager wants to make sure the biggest players that drive the digital economy -- a la Amazon -- are not abusing their market dominance and hurting consumers as they use data from competitors\u00a0to inform their own business decisions.\u00a0 \r\n A\u00a0formal case against Amazon\u00a0could set the tone for how policymakers across the world -- even in the U.S. -- might treat the issue.\u00a0 \r\n It extends\u00a0far beyond one\u00a0e-commerce giant, Vestager told me.\u00a0Amazon is not the only one, Vestager said.\u00a0Google also has this nature because they also are being the navigation tool to find a lot of businesses, businesses that they themselves compete with.\u00a0 \r\n Vestager said Google Shopping is another example of her worries. In 2017, she fined Google for steering customers to its own service that lets people compare products from around the Web over competing online shopping services. \r\n That\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0fine and others\u00a0have built Vestager's reputation as Silicon Valley's top nemesis across the pond.\u00a0And\u00a0at a time when many American politicians are just\u00a0talking about antitrust and reining in Big Tech, Vestager has built a record on taking action. She\u00a0also fined the search engine a record-setting $5 billion for forcing Android phone manufacturers to pre-install the Google search app and Chrome Web app on the phones. She's also fined Amazon and Apple for failing to pay taxes. \r\n As 2020 Democratic presidential candidates steered the conversation at South by Southwest toward how they would regulate the technology industry, there was perhaps no more approporiate year for Vestager to attend the festival.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n But her approach differs from that of\u00a0presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who gave an impassioned pitch at the festival for her plan to break up Big Tech.\u00a0 \r\n When I asked her about Warren's plan, Vestager said Europe could also try to break up the companies through legislation.\u00a0It would for us be an issue of the very, very, very last resort, she said.\u00a0 \r\n Warren (D-Mass.) and Vestager\u00a0are concerned about the same competition issue, though.\u00a0In our interview, Warren said she wanted to break up Amazon so it could not unfairly use the data it collects from sellers to compete with them.\u00a0 \r\n As Vestager looks long-term at the work she wants to do to ensure European\u00a0authorities are prepared to address competition\u00a0issues involving technology, she tells me she's closely watching the hearings the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is holding on how the agency should address digital challenges.\u00a0 \r\n \"I really like this approach, that they get a stock taking,\" she said. \"We're interested as colleagues and colleagues from my services will come over and have a listening ear.\" \r\n BITS: Warren says Facebook's decision to remove (and later restore) her ads calling for the breakup of tech giants underscores her point: that the social network has too much power.\u00a0 \r\n Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTechhttps://t.co/UPS6dozOxn \r\n Facebook removed several of Warren's posts yesterday that called for the unwinding of several large technology mergers, including Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. After Politico spotted the ads' removal, the company later restored them.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n We removed the ads because they violated our policies against use of our corporate logo, the company said in a statement. In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads. \r\n NIBBLES: The Department of Homeland Security is rushing to deploy facial recognition systems across the country to comply with an executive order, but it's doing so without proper vetting and\u00a0using methods some privacy advocates say are against the law, according to BuzzFeed News's Davey Alba.\u00a0 \r\n U.S. Customs and Border Protection is scrambling to implement this biometric entry-exit system, with the goal of using facial recognition technology on travelers aboard 16,300 flights per week or more than 100 million passengers traveling on international flights out of the United States in as little as two years, to meet Trump's accelerated timeline for a biometric system that had initially been signed into law by the Obama administration, according to 346 pages of documents shared with BuzzFeed.\u00a0 \r\n Officials are rushing to implement the system with few legal guardrails, at a time when there are serious questions about the accuracy of facial recognition technology especially among certain racial minorities.\u00a0 \r\n Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) responded on Twitter: \r\n Im a believer in privacy - which means I reject unlimited, unchecked, warrantless surveillance. \r\n Tracking consent should be given freely (aka not holding a service hostage for it) - whether its a gov or a corp. \r\n Warrants, & their requirements, are supposed to mean something. https://t.co/RY2jtLYLCp \r\n BYTES: Elon Musk is pushing back against the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion to hold him in contempt of court, calling it an \"unconstitutional power grab\" in a response filing,\u00a0according to CNET's Daniel Van Boom.\u00a0 \r\n The Tesla chief executive said he did not violate a previous settlement that put restrictions on his use of social media and that the government is trying to silence him. Under this settlement, Musk was supposed to have lawyers preapprove any tweets that could impact the company's stock. But the SEC says Musk's tweet from Feb. 19 about production levels hadn't been reviewed by the company's lawyers, in violation of the court's order.\u00a0 \r\n The tweet was simply Musks shorthand gloss on and entirely consistent with prior public disclosures detailing Teslas anticipated production volume, Musks lawyers wrote. Moreover, it is clear from the context of the tweet that it was celebratory and forward-lookinga type of statement that courts have concluded is immaterial as a matter of law. \r\n As Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0reorients the company toward privacy and encrypted messaging, little-seen data suggests that many users were already moving away from Facebook's core social network, my colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin reports. \r\n According to the analysis of data Facebook shared with TV ratings company Nielsen, people in the United States have been spending a lot less time on Facebook and on Messenger since 2016 about 10 percent less time per person in any given month than they had in the same month the previous year, Dwoskin\u00a0wrote. And that is true for all age brackets. \r\n Presidet Trump is on the defensive after a video of him calling the chief executive of Apple \"Tim Apple\" at a White House event last week went viral.\u00a0In a tweet yesterday, he said it was a \"easy way to save time & words.\" \r\n At a recent round table meeting of business executives, & long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple, I quickly referred to Tim Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time & words. The Fake News was disparagingly all over this, & it became yet another bad Trump story! \r\n  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2019 \r\n The tweet only gave the viral story -- and jokes about it-- a second wind.\u00a0 \r\n People are criticizing Trump for saying he said \"Tim Apple\" to save time.

You may not be fired\"", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-03-12T05:00:00Z", "origContent": "When most Americans are fast asleep -- 6am in London -- Tesla pushed out a press release Monday which, to be honest, is pretty sensational, even for a company promising rocket-assisted cars. \r\n Last month, we announced that we would be winding down many of our stores and moving to online-only sales in order to pass the savings along to our customers. \r\n This was only ten days ago! We feel old. Anyway. \r\n On an invite-only media conference call following the original February 28 announcement (we're sure our invite got lost in the post), Elon Musk explained the decision was not just about cost-savings, but also because \u201cit\u2019s 2019. People want to buy things online\u201d. The consumer demanded it, and Tesla was ready to oblige. Who needs to be guided through the process of buying a $35,000 asset anyway? \r\n Well it turns out... (emphasis ours): \r\n Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months. When we recently closed 10% of sales locations, we selected stores that didn\u2019t invite the natural foot traffic our stores have always been designed for. These are stores that we would have closed anyway, even if in-store sales made up our entire sales model. A few stores in high visibility locations that were closed due to low throughput will be reopened, but with a smaller Tesla crew. In addition, there are another 20% of locations that are under review, and depending on their effectiveness over the next few months, some will be closed and some will remain open. \r\n Perhaps it was the real cost of cancelling the leases that did it. According to Tesla\u2019s latest 10-K filing, operating lease obligations amount to $1.6bn over the next five years. While not all related to its stores, even paying off its landlords a quarter of that could be problematic for a company where every dollar of cash flow is crucial. (For more, read this excellent WSJ article from the weekend.) \r\n As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. In other words, we will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half. \r\n Ah price rises, just a fortnight after cutting prices for all of its cars worldwide. That makes total sense. We\u2019re sure that extra 3 per cent is going to make all the difference to the UK-based, full spec Model X buyers who spent \u00a3137,705 on their cars on February 27, only to find the price drop to \u00a387,200 on March 1. (Numbers courtesy of AutoExpress.) \r\n Potential Tesla owners will have a week to place their order before prices rise, so current prices are valid until March 18th. There will be no price increase to the $35,000 Model 3. The price increases will only apply to the more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X. \r\n Alphaville is sure this has nothing to do with the fact that most of the expensive variants are likely to be in-stock, and therefore almost sure to be delivered before the quarter-end if ordered this week. \r\n To be clear, all sales worldwide will still be done online, in that potential Tesla owners coming in to stores will simply be shown how to order a Tesla on their phone in a few minutes. And the generous return policy of 1000 miles or 7 days, whichever comes first, should alleviate the need for most test drives. However, cars will still be available for test drives at stores at the potential Tesla owner\u2019s request. Stores will also carry a small number of cars in inventory for customers who wish to drive away with a Tesla immediately. \r\n Ah, so it turns out customers do like trying-before-they-buy when it comes to the second most expensive purchase of their lifetimes. Who knew? Of course, returning a car after 1,000 miles may be tricky if there's so few stores to return it to. But we digress. \r\n While these numbers may strike our readers as very low, we also note reduced US sales estimates from Inside EVs, a trade website Mr Musk tweeted last summer, when the site reported impressive market share figures for the Model 3. \r\n It estimates Tesla sold 12,250 Model 3s and 3,725 Model S/Xs through February. However, it's important to highlight that Tesla has made a sustained effort to ship cars to Europe and Asia this quarter, so this could explain the reported drop in US sales. \r\n But if Mr Chowdhry is close to correct, then his research may explain the seemingly rushed nature of Tesla's sales strategy.  \r\n Think about it this way: when it comes to mistakes, growth companies have it easy. Rocketing revenues can often mask underperforming segments, or bad investment decisions, thanks to the mollifying nature of rising positive cash flows. Just think how easily Amazon recovered from the debacle of the Fire Phone, for example. \r\n When the music stops, however, the reverse is equally true. Unexpectedly slow growth means once trivial issues can become acute problems. And, in an effort to maintain profits, companies often rush to hasty strategic decisions. A write-off may be taken, or a business segment restructured.

Ms Warren said she would introduce legislation that prevented companies such as Amazon from operating a marketplace and participating in that marketplace. \r\n James Thomson, a former Amazon manager who consults sellers on the ecommerce platform, said the decision to axe price parity provisions could result in slower growth for Amazon. \r\n \u201cThe Marketplace has been historically a cash cow for Amazon. If it becomes less competitive on price and consumers become less loyal, does that mean the third-party business is going to slow down?\u201d he said. \r\n The explosive growth of the Marketplace has helped propel the company\u2019s growth and provided an economic model with more attractive margins than Amazon\u2019s own sales of goods. The company takes a cut of sales and charges merchants fees for fulfilment, payment and advertising services, but does not bear the cost and risk of purchasing and holding inventory. Revenue from those services grew twice as fast in the fourth quarter from a year ago as Amazon\u2019s own online sales. \r\n But Marketplace has also provided fodder for critics who argue that Amazon has too much leverage over sellers and uses the data it gleans from all the sales that go across its platform to benefit its own business. \r\n European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager last year launched an investigation into how Amazon uses data about its merchants. Germany\u2019s antitrust watchdog has opened a separate probe into the company\u2019s \u201cdouble role\u201d as a retailer and marketplace for sellers and whether the company abused its market power to set illegal contract terms. \r\n Such concerns have also started to emerge in the US, particularly among Democrats. In December, Richard Blumenthal, a senator from Connecticut, wrote to the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission urging regulators to investigate Amazon\u2019s contract provisions, which he said \u201ccould stifle market competition and artificially inflate prices on consumer goods\u201d. \r\n After Amazon\u2019s move on Monday, Mr Blumenthal said the \u201cwise and welcome decision comes only after aggressive advocacy and attention that compelled Amazon to abandon its abusive contract clause\u201d, adding: \u201cI remain deeply troubled that federal regulators responsible for cracking down on anti-competitive practices seem asleep at the wheel, at great cost to American innovation and consumers.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3beea4a6-445b-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3", "tags": ["dan diamond", "budget plan", "john wagner", "william booth", "toluse olorunnipa"], "related_articles": [{"title": "The Health 202: Utah is testing the Trump administration's dreams of limiting Medicaid spending", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2019/03/13/the-health-202-utah-is-testing-the-trump-administration-s-dreams-of-limiting-medicaid-spending/5c880bce1b326b2d177d6067/"}, {"title": "The Daily 202: Russia may experiment with new forms of interference in Ukraine\u2019s elections, experts warn", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/03/13/daily-202-russia-may-experiment-with-new-forms-of-interference-in-ukraine-s-elections-experts-warn/5c87d39a1b326b2d177d6060/"}, {"title": "Ocasio-Cortez fact-checked for 'highly misleading' claim on Trump funding for opioid emergency - Fox News", "source": "fox-news", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fact-checked-for-highly-misleading-comment-on-president-trump-opioid-crisis"}]}]}
