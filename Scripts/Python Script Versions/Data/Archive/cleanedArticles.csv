Under Armour Inc. will report fourth-quarter financial results pre-market Tuesday. Analysts largely expect the quarterly report and the 2019 forecast to be inline with the forecasts provided at the company’s December 12 
investor day. Particular interest will be paid to commentary around gross margin, regional sales results, inventory positions, new product innovation and the company’s promotional cadence.
Options activity is pointing to a volatile reaction into the earnings release, which isn’t uncommon as shares have moved 14.9 percent on average over the last eight reports. Contracts set to expire on Friday are pricing in a one-day move of 12.7 percent.
Current implied volatility is elevated, trading around 148 percent versus a three-month average of 61. Twenty percent of total open interest is scheduled to expire and of those contracts, calls are outpacing puts by almost two to one, indicating a somewhat bullish set-up.
Short interest represented 23 percent of float, according to Markit data, may add to an active session tomorrow.
Here’s what analysts are watching in the quarterly earnings release:
Stifel, Jim Duffy
Expect UAA to meet or exceed firm’s 4Q revenue (slightly above consensus) and consensus-matching adjusted EPS estimates and reiterate 2019 forecasts, although Stifel expects upward potential as year progresses
Focus will be on 4Q details including regional trends, gross margins and inventory positions
Remains bullish, particularly on opportunities for gross margin recovery and upside to preliminary expectations for 60-80bps y/y expansion; rate buy, price target $30
Piper Jaffray, Erinn Murphy
4Q release will be an opportunity to revisit key themes from 
the Investor Day: improving gross margin dynamics; better segmentation; return to growth in North America &amp; innovation (particularly in footwear)
Checks point to lower promotional activity vs last year; saw newness hit floors &amp; online last week, Curry 6 was “almost completely"" sold out of the Black/Yellow colorway at UA.com and Foot Locker
Expects 2019 EPS view of 31c-33c to move higher throughout the year, and sees room for revenue and operating margin upside; rates overweight, price target $30
What Bloomberg Intelligence is saying:
“Recent results suggest Under Armour is correcting operational issues of the past two years, yet we haven’t seen evidence that demand for the brand is improving. The company debuted footwear for the growing performance-running segment, but high January discounts suggest 2019 began with excess inventory and margin pressure.”--Chen Grazutis
Telsey Advisory, Cristina Fernandez
Focus will be on 1Q outlook and the “flow of sales and operating margin improvement through 2019 in light of product launches and lapping off-price sales last year”
On call, looks for update on 2019 product pipeline, particularly around planned growth and distribution for the new HOVR footwear line that launched February 1
Supply chain initiatives (40% less SKUs), fewer promotional days, improved product costs and cleaner inventories should aid margins
But given stock’s premium valuation, higher North American sales growth is needed for the shares to appreciate from here; rates market perform, PT $21 
William Blair, Sharon Zackfia
Expects 4Q sales decline of about 4% in North America, a low-double digit increase in international; direct-to-consumer sales should outpace wholesale (up low- to mid-single digit versus a low-single-digit decline in wholesale)
Adjusted gross margin should expand 170 bps y/y to 45% on product cost favorability and lower planned promotional activity, partly offset by inventory management actions 
Expects 2019 guidance will be reiterated; for 1Q, expects low-single-digit revenue growth to yield break-even EPS as improved gross margin will be largely offset by higher SG&amp;A inclusive of increased marketing expenses

Just a simple click and you're done? If you're using a computer and are on the classic Amazon.com retail site, you'd be right. It is. 
 Why, then, does the Google search ""how do I sign out of Amazon"" get more than 1,990,000 hits? Because when using an Amazon app, watching Prime TV, or you're on the main site via mobile device, signing out of Amazon actually isn't that easy. 
 Why is it hard to sign out of Amazon? Well, first of all, Amazon is trying to make things easy for you. What a pain to have to sign in every time you want to buy some socks or watch a show or listen to music! If you stay logged in, all that stuff is just a tap or click away. 
 Second, it's in Amazon's interest to have you stay logged in — after all, a lot of that stuff that's a tap or click away makes them money. The added step of the login might give pause, preventing the impulse buy. 
 The good news is that the power is in your hands: once you know where to find the sign out spot on an Amazon page or app, the whole process takes mere seconds. 
How to sign out of Amazon's website
A desktop sign-out is pretty straightforward.
 Steven John/Business Insider

 Move your cursor to hover over the words ""Accounts &amp; Lists"" near the top right of the page. 
 At the bottom of the drop down menu labeled ""Your Account,"" click on ""Sign Out."" 
That's it, you're out. 
How to sign out of Amazon on a mobile browser
Signing out differs a bit on a mobile web browser.
 Steven John/Business Insider 
The sign-out process on a mobile web browser is similarly straightforward, but differs slightly from a desktop sign-out. 
 Click the three horizontal bars at the top left corner of the browser page. 
 Scroll down to the ""Help &amp; Settings"" section. 
 Click ""Sign Out."" 
How to sign out of the Amazon app on Android or iPhone
 Signing out of Amazon's app on a mobile device is a bit trickier, but only because the button with which to sign out takes a few taps to find. 
 Open the app, and tap the ""Menu"" at the top left corner of the screen. 
 On the menu that appears, tap ""Settings."" 
 On the next menu, tap ""Not NAME? Sign out."" 
And... you're out. 
How to sign out of the Amazon app on iPad
 Getting signed out of Amazon on an iPad is similar to Android and iPhone, but it starts slightly differently.

On the surface it may seem that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and President Donald Trump may have a good deal in common. They are both powerful men whose names are associated with money. 
But it doesn't take too much digging to see how vastly different they are. And this latest scandal involving Bezos, the tabloid National Enquirer newspaper and a few nude photographs couldn't divide the men more. Late-night comic Bill Maher uses the accusations from Bezos  that the Enquirer is attempting to blackmail him  to examine the connections and the divide between the two men. 
Jimmy Fallon points out how this mishap falls in line with so many other things that Amazon has done wrong. And you wouldn't think there'd be a connection between Bezos and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. Saturday Night Live's Colin Jost says not so fast.

By correcting one potential error, health officials in Ventura County, California, accidentally made another and jeopardized vaccines given to thousands of people.
County health officials, concerned that vaccines were getting too warm while being transported to clinics, changed their protocol in 2017. But a routine audit found that the ice packs they were using might have frozen some of the medicines and reduced their effectiveness.
Officials offered to re-immunize anyone who received a vaccine that was delivered in faulty packaging.
""There's no way to tell whether or not they were ineffective, said Jason Arimura, director of pharmacy Director of Pharmacy Services at Ventura County Medical Center. Out of an abundance of caution, he said, we just notified everyone.""
The number of patients affected: 23,000.
It's not the only case of vaccines feared to be ineffective reaching patients. In the past 13 months alone, 117 children at an Indian Health Service clinic in Oklahoma City received vaccines against polio, meningococcal disease and the human papillomavirus that were refrigerated improperly.
Similar problems with temperature control prompted a health clinic in Indianapolis to send letters last year offering to revaccinate 1,600 people, according to local news reports.
Now Kentucky officials say potentially ineffective and contaminated vaccines were administered at multiple businesses across Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.

The federal government sets standards on the storage of vaccines. But not all health care providers are accountable under those guidelines.
The federal Vaccines for Children program, which offers these drugs at no cost to kids from low-income families, requires clinics, doctors and other providers to use state-of-the-art equipment, such as devices that monitor temperature continuously, and undergo annual audits. It also requires providers to report problems to federal authorities.
More than 44,000 doctors participate in the program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They provide vaccines to 90 percent of the nation's children.
But medical facilities outside of the program  including many pharmacies and internists with private practices have no comparable federal oversight. Protocols for storing vaccines and whether they report cases of patients receiving ineffective drugs are left largely up to their discretion.

Analysts say most hospitals, clinics and doctors are vigilant in storing their vaccines properly. Research suggests that giving compromised vaccines to patients is not harmful.
L.J Tan, chief strategy officer for the nonprofit vaccination advocacy group Immunization Action Coalition, said the nations vaccine stock is likely among the safest in the world.
But Dr. Julie Boom, a pediatrician and director of the immunization project at Texas Childrens Hospital, warned that handling these medications improperly means wasting expensive drugs, and using compromised vaccines could create a pocket of under-immunized individuals.
""We don't want that to happen,"" she said.
In Ventura County, the temperature problems affected vaccines for flu shots, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and hepatitis B. Officials told patients who had received tuberculosis testing, and some who received penicillin to treat syphilis, that their medicines also might have been compromised.
Approximately 1,200 had returned to be revaccinated through January, Arimura says. Revaccinating all 23,000 people would cost $1.3 million, he says.
Vaccines are extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations. In some cases, Tan says, exposing a vaccine to the wrong environment once can effectively kill live viruses and harm proteins in the vaccines.
Generally, temperature problems occur during when medicines are transported.
Without proper monitoring, Boom says, it's nearly impossible to tell whether vaccines have been exposed to extreme temperatures.

The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services studied Vaccines for Children providers in 2012.
In a two-week period, the inspector general found, three-quarters of the 45 providers sampled exposed their vaccines to improper temperatures for at least five cumulative hours.
In a separate study, researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 23 percent of the vaccination errors reported to the federal surveillance system from 2000 to 2013 involved improper storage or the use of expired vaccines.
Since these reports, the CDC put in place additional requirements for the childrens program, including recording the minimum and maximum temperature of the vaccine storage unit daily.
Dr. Paul Hunter, associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Wisconsin, said the federal oversight is very good.
In the big picture, they do it very consistently, he said.
Outside the federal surveillance system, financial concerns can create an incentive for doctors and clinics to take special care with vaccines. One dose can cost hundreds of dollars.
Sanford Health, a South Dakota-based health care system with operations throughout the Midwest, is working to make the federal requirements the standard for vaccines among its health care providers.
The system started Vax Champ, a six-month training program that teaches nurses how to store and handle vaccines properly. The program requires participants to periodically take photos of their vaccine stocks and send in inventory lists for review.
Funding for the program came from the vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur.
Andrea Polkinghorn, immunization strategy leader for Sanford Health, says vaccine storage systems vary widely among providers. Purchasing pharmaceutical-grade storage equipment is costly, she says, and providers are in different phases of the upgrade. 
But when you compare that to the projected loss of vaccines, Polkinghorn said, the end is worth the means.

In the latest example of fashion stumbling over styles that resemble racist imagery, Katy Perry's shoe label pulled two potentially problematic pairs Monday from its online site, although they are still available at some major retailers.
The Katy Perry Collections label no longer features either the Rue Face slip-on loafer or the Ora Face block-heel sandal on its website. Both shoes, which sell for $129, come in black, gold or beige.
The black versions are the more startling: They feature metal appliques imitating eyes and nose, plus exaggerated red lips on the vamp, the upper part of the shoes. 
The shoes are available at major retailers such as Dillards, Forever 21 and Lord &amp; Taylor. The label also is sold at retailers such as Macys, Zappos and Amazon but the shoes in question are not currently available on their websites.
The shoes are not going over well with some on Twitter, after a series of blackface controversies has roiled several fashion companies, plus imperiled the political careers of the governor and the attorney general of Virginia. 
""Ok, can we just make this a rule that ANY product, service or person that is NOT Black will NOT create, promote or apply any combination of BLACK + FACE Can we just make this a thing,"" tweeted user @KimCrayton1.

A spokesperson for the Katy Perry Collections label did not return a message from USA TODAY. 
The Perry shoes resemble a Gucci wool sweater that was pulled last week after it sparked outrage on social media for appearing to mimic blackface, the 19th-century racist practice in which white people darken their skin to create caricatures of black people. 
The $890 sweater, from Gucci's Fall Winter 2018 runway show, featured a turtleneck meant to be pulled up over the nose, with a red-lined cutout for the wearer's mouth. Gucci apologized and removed the sweater from its physical and online stores.
Prada also apologized and removed a monkey bag charm resembling blackface in December. 
Director Spike Lee said last week he would boycott wearing Gucci and Prada until the brands hire some black designers following these fashion fails from the two major Italian fashion houses.
And fashion collaborator Daniel ""Dapper Dan"" Day, the Harlem-based designer who collaborated with Gucci on a menswear line in 2017, said on Instagram Sunday ""there is no excuse or apology that can erase this kind of insult,"" and claimed the CEO of Gucci has agreed to meet with him and members of the community in Harlem.
In an interview with Footwear News in October, Perry said she was devoting more time to other projects besides music, including her shoe line, which she described as ""full of personality"" and ""affordable."" 
Ive tried to put many a different figure or ornament on the heels, just to tell a story and to hopefully start conversations via your feet,"" she said, comparing designing footwear to singing. ""Music in a way is the same thing. Hopefully, people talk about the songs.
Sarah Ader, sales director for Katy Perry Collections, said the line features ""details and flair"" characteristic of Perry.

raises 300 million at a 3 billion valuationInvestors include Tencent Sequoia Fidelity and Andreessen HorowitzCEO Steve Huffman says the company will use the investment to improve Reddits website and work to take digital ad market share away from Facebook and GoogleJulia BoorstinWhat do Sen Kamala Harris Toyota Charles Schwab and Jordan Peeles new movie Us all have in commonThey all turned to Reddit to deploy ad campaigns and connect with consumers The social networks growth in popularity with a broad range of advertisers has attracted new investors and is driving up its valuationThe company announced Monday it has raised 300 million at a 3 billion valuation Thats up from a 18 billion valuation when the company took in a 200 million in investment in 2017Chinese giant Tencent is the newcomer in this series D round investing 150 million and joining prior investors in the company With this financing the company says it plans to expand internationally and grow its ad platform targeting the market dominated by Facebook and Google News that Reddit was raising a round with Tencent as an investor was previously reported by TechCrunchReddit CEO Steve Huffman sat down with CNBC for an interview to discuss the financing and whats next for the companyOne of the things thats been very important to us is that we can now assure advertisers that you are going to have a positive experience on Reddit and potentially even a new experience a new way of connecting with customers Huffman said He said Reddits commitment to advertisers is to make that connection free from abuse and other kinds of misbehavingSince Reddit was founded in 2005 it has drawn criticism and concerns over abuse harassment and piracy on the platform But Huffman said the company has invested in better technology to catch abuse and better tools for its users to report itThe tools are working he said Reddit has grown its appeal to advertisers with 330 million monthly active users half of whom are between the ages of 18 and 24 a valuable hardtoreach demographic While the company wont reveal its revenue it brought in more than 100 million last yearWe are reinventing the ads business both on the technology side and our ability to sell it and to create a friendly home for users and brands alike Huffman said So weve made steady progress on all of these fronts over the last year and we feel pretty proud of where we are And as a result we are seeing a lot of attention from both brands and investorsTencents investment is notable Not only is Reddit blocked in China but the platform is known as a bastion for free unedited speech But the investment makes more sense considering that Tencent is an investor in some of the video game companies that drive conversations on Reddit Tencent owns 40 percent of Fortnite creator Epic Games Tencent is also a big investor in another social service banned in China The company became Snaps largest shareholder in late 2017 and currently owns nearly 15 percent of the public companyThey are investors in lots of video games companies Huffman said And video games are one category thats really popular on RedditWe are the only company at our scale thats still a private company so weve had a lot of investor attention in the last year So we found ourselves in a good position to get something done right now Huffman saidNow with this additional financing Huffman said he hopes to take a piece of Facebooks and Googles massive market share in online advertisingWhen we are talking about competing for ad dollars of course we are talking about Facebook and Google who take up the vast majority of ad spend He said that when it comes to competition for consumers We are competing with anybody or anywhere people spend their free timeOne key to growth Huffman said is making the Reddit website which can be cluttered and hard to navigate easier for newcomers to accessWhen we think about internationalization obviously thats our largest opportunity for user growth Huffman said We still want to get the fundamentals of Reddit working perfectly in the US where we understand the language and the culture and I still think we have opportunities to do better thereReflecting on a year dominated by negative headlines around Facebook and on Reddits own work to make its platform safe Huffman said Reddits growth is predicated on eliminating the kind of abuse that can alienate users and brandsWeve learned many lessons over the years and one of the most important ones is that user safety and trust is extremely important Huffman said Weve also seen in the last year how challenging things can be if you dont get that right and how high the stakes are We do believe the stakes are increasingAlongside Tencent the other investors in this round include

Investors include Tencent, Sequoia, Fidelity and Andreessen Horowitz.
CEO Steve Huffman says the company will use the investment to improve Reddit's website and work to take digital ad market share away from Facebook and Google.

What do Sen. Kamala Harris, Toyota, Charles Schwab and Jordan Peele's new movie ""Us"" all have in common?
They all turned to Reddit to deploy ad campaigns and connect with consumers. The social network's growth in popularity with a broad range of advertisers has attracted new investors and is driving up its valuation.
The company announced Monday it has raised $300 million at a $3 billion valuation. That's up from a $1.8 billion valuation when the company took in a $200 million in investment in 2017.
Chinese giant Tencent is the newcomer in this series D round, investing $150 million and joining prior investors in the company. With this financing, the company says it plans to expand internationally and grow its ad platform, targeting the market dominated by Facebook and Google. News that Reddit was raising a round with Tencent as an investor was previously reported by TechCrunch.
Reddit CEO Steve Huffman sat down with CNBC for an interview to discuss the financing and what's next for the company.
""One of the things that's been very important to us is that we can now assure advertisers that you are going to have a positive experience on Reddit and potentially even a new experience, a new way of connecting with customers,"" Huffman said. He said Reddit's commitment to advertisers is to make that connection ""free from abuse and other kinds of misbehaving.""
Since Reddit was founded in 2005, it has drawn criticism and concerns over abuse, harassment and piracy on the platform. But Huffman said the company has invested in better technology to catch abuse and better tools for its users to report it.
The tools are working, he said. Reddit has grown its appeal to advertisers with 330 million monthly active users, half of whom are between the ages of 18 and 24, a valuable, hard-to-reach demographic. While the company won't reveal its revenue, it brought in more than $100 million last year.
""We are reinventing the ads business, both on the technology side and our ability to sell it and to create a friendly home for users and brands alike,"" Huffman said. ""So we've made steady progress on all of these fronts over the last year, and we feel pretty proud of where we are. And as a result we are seeing a lot of attention from both brands and investors.""
Tencent's investment is notable. Not only is Reddit blocked in China, but the platform is known as a bastion for free, unedited speech. But the investment makes more sense considering that Tencent is an investor in some of the video game companies that drive conversations on Reddit. Tencent owns 40 percent of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games. Tencent is also a big investor in another social service banned in China. The company became Snap's largest shareholder in late 2017, and currently owns nearly 15 percent of the public company.
""They are investors in lots of video games companies,"" Huffman said. ""And video games are one category that's really popular on Reddit.""
""We are the only company at our scale that's still a private company, so we've had a lot of investor attention in the last year. So we found ourselves in a good position to get something done right now,"" Huffman said.
Now, with this additional financing, Huffman said he hopes to take a piece of Facebook's and Google's massive market share in online advertising.
""When we are talking about competing for ad dollars, of course we are talking about Facebook and Google, who take up the vast majority of ad spend."" He said that when it comes to competition for consumers, ""We are competing with anybody, or anywhere people spend their free time.""
One key to growth, Huffman said, is making the Reddit website, which can be cluttered and hard to navigate, easier for newcomers to access.
""When we think about internationalization, obviously that's our largest opportunity for user growth,"" Huffman said. ""We still want to get the fundamentals of Reddit working perfectly in the U.S., where we understand the language and the culture, and I still think we have opportunities to do better there.""
Reflecting on a year dominated by negative headlines around Facebook and on Reddit's own work to make its platform safe, Huffman said Reddit's growth is predicated on eliminating the kind of abuse that can alienate users and brands.
""We've learned many lessons over the years, and one of the most important ones is that user safety and trust is extremely important,"" Huffman said. ""We've also seen in the last year how challenging things can be if you don't get that right and how high the stakes are. We do believe the stakes are increasing.""
Alongside Tencent, the other investors in this round include Sequoia, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, Quiet Capital, VY and Snoop Dogg.

A draft class is only as interesting as its quarterbacks, and outside of the 2018 Heisman Trophy winner, the available passers in this class are … basic.
How the sports world reacted to Kyler Murray choosing the NFL over MLB
By “basic,” I mean none of the top guys — Dwayne Haskins, Drew Lock, etc. — possess any truly special traits. Murray does, obviously. He’s got game-breaking speed and agility to go along with an arm that is capable of making throws like this…
I would call Murray a once-in-a-generation quarterback prospect, but we just saw Lamar Jackson, the greatest running quarterback in the history of college football, so I won’t resort to such hyperbole. But while Murray is not the runner Jackson is (though it is close), he is more refined as a passer (and it’s not that close). Murray’s mechanics will need work if he’s ever going to develop into a consistently accurate passer, but he is a natural thrower who can complete passes from different arm angles — a trait shared by numerous quarterbacks with a background in baseball.
Because of the highlight-reel runs, some scouts and analysts may write off Murray as a scramble. And while scrambling is certainly is a major part of his game, the Oklahoma product showed he was willing to be patient in the pocket. He had to be against Big XII defenses that rushed only three defensive linemen and dropped eight defenders into coverage.
Murray’s play style will not be the biggest issue for scouts, of course. It will be his height that gives NFL front office the most pause. Murray is listed at 5-foot-10 but even that seems generous. However tall he may be, the lack of height did not seem to be an issue for Murray, who was able to see downfield even in rapidly closing pockets.
Despite the success of shorter quarterbacks in today’s era of wide-open offense — where skill has become more important than size and strength — some NFL teams will disregard all of the brilliant film Murray produced last season simply because he doesn’t meet their height requirement for quarterbacks and focus on the more prototypical prospects in this class.
Haskins and Lock look more like quarterbacks but there’s nothing special about them as players. Haskins broke all kinds of records at Ohio State but did so behind a dominant offensive line while throwing to wide-open receivers who could turn a simple screen pass into a long touchdown.
When Haskins was forced to throw downfield and manage pressure in a condensed pocket, his accuracy fell off a cliff.
Lock is a better athlete than Haskins is — don’t tell Stephen A. Smith that — but he’s a reckless decision-maker whose physical ability does not make up for those lapses in judgment. The Brett Favre/Patrick Mahomes mentality really only works for aliens like Favre and Mahomes.
Buffalo’s Tyree Jackson has a special arm but has the lowest floor of any of the top quarterback prospects in the class. Duke’s Daniel Jones is this year stock tall, white dude who gets old scouts all worked up. West Virginia’s Will Grier is the player Colin Cowherd thinks Baker Mayfield is. Boise State’s Brett Rypien could very well develop into a starter one day but will probably lead the league in interceptions if he ever does.
The No. 1 pick should be reserved for players with Hall-of-Fame potential. For special prospects who can carry a franchise for a decade. There is only one quarterback in this class capable of doing that, and that’s Murray.
A lot has to break right for the 21-year-old to reach his potential. But if some team out there helps him do so, Murray will dominate the league. The same cannot be said for Haskins, Lock or any other quarterback in the 2019 draft class.

When working on campaigns and experiences, how do you incorporate both the left- and right-brained sides of marketing?
Grossman: It requires thinking differently about process, people, and performance. For process, the way we work is becoming less linear and more iterative.

You work with marketers in many different organizations and industries. Based on what youve seen, how do you recommend CMOs approach new technologies and platforms? How can they make more effective investments?
Many brands are undergoing digital transformation, and they are having different degrees of success. My advice: Dont let perfection be the enemy of progress.

Last, its important to have a business case for adopting each new technology and for the teams who will use the platform every day to understand that business case.
What strategies or tactics can help foster an innovation mindset?
Innovation happens when people think in new ways and create connections that werent there before. One effective tactic we’ve used is the right-brain workout. The idea is to expose people to stimuli they dont encounter every day. That could mean, for example, visiting a museum, listening to a Zen master speak, going on an architectural boat tour, or taking an improv class.

Which technologies are exciting to you as a marketer?
There are several, but technologies that engage with humans using natural language, like chatbots and voice assistants, are particularly promising. I dont expect them to completely replace human interface, but there are so many service requests that can be answered much more easily and effectively by automated technology.

Safeguarding creative ideas and advocating for new technologies requires CMOs to have strong relationships. Which stakeholder connections are important for marketers to foster?  
A strong relationship with the CIO is fundamental, especially as organizations seek to be responsible stewards of customer data. Second, because CMOs are increasingly expected to drive business value, close collaboration with the CEO is critical. This can help marketers ensure theyre truly aligned to business priorities. Third, as a CMO, I would think carefully about my relationships with agency partners. Our best and longest relationships with clients are built on deep mutual respect, a willingness to push each other, radical transparency, and a desire to have our teams work seamlessly as extensions of one another."

Some blockchain start-ups, regardless of having talented teams of engineers, haven't been able to prove a use case and are struggling to fund operations as the price of cryptocurrencies nosedives. Employees are slowly becoming free agents, which is good news for companies like Facebook.
The social media giant recently scooped up employees from start-up Chainspace, according to a report by Cheddar. Facebook confirmed to CNBC that it had hired a handful of employees but said it did not buy the company or its technology.
Chainspace is a crypto startup founded by PhD researchers from University College of London. Two of these founders are now listed as Facebook employees on LinkedIn. According to its website, the start-up is focused on ""giving people ownership of their personal data"" through a project called ""DECODE.""
In a note to clients last week, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney highlighted blockchain as a threat to Facebook and other major tech companies. The Internet is still at the ""embryonic stages of a potential massive paradigm shift"" to computing on public blockchains, according to Mahaney. That shift ""could be a long term risk to Facebook's underlying business model,"" he said.
Mahaney categorized Facebook's move as an ""acqui-hire"" a popular Silicon Valley term for when a company acquires a company only to recruit its employees.
""On the surface, it may appear that Facebook purposefully hired the technical team related to DECODE. But we don't believe this was the case,"" Mahaney said. ""Our view is that this was simply an acqui-hire to expand Facebook's internal crypto team's expertise.""
Facebook is on a growing list of tech companies testing out the blockchain space, with former PayPal executive David Marcus leading its charge. Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and J. P. Morgan are among others looking at use cases for the technology, which supporters call more transparent and more secure than existing data systems.
But like the internet, the best way to monetize it might not be obvious immediately.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""I think we've got a mania going on in buybacks and a mania going on terms of shareholder primacy,"" Jones told CNBC's Bob Pisani on the sidelines Monday of the Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Florida. He added that the focus solely on shareholder profits has helped cause major wealth disparity and is a departure from the way corporate boards used to behave.
""Things have been different and can be different again, and if they're not I'm really nervous about what the ultimate social consequences are in this country,"" he said.
U.S. companies bought back more than $1 trillion of their own shares in 2018, helping to keep afloat a market that turned in an otherwise lackluster performance as the S&amp;P 500 was off more than 6 percent for the year. However, the propensity of companies to use the trillions in cash they are holding has caused controversy and calls for legislators to limit the practice.
Specifically, Sens. Charles Schumer and Bernie Sanders recently proposed requiring companies to meet certain requirements before being allowed to do repurchases. Among the standards would be minimum employee pay of $15 an hour along with paid time off and health benefits.
Jones said he wasn't sure if wanted to go that far. He said he has been speaking with Schumer, a New York Democrat, for over a year on his ideas about socially responsible investing.
""I don't know if I want to see a legislative outcome for this,"" Jones said. ""I'd love to see this happen organically.""
Before companies make buybacks, board members should ask whether their employees are making living wages, and should look into how much the companies are contributing to charity, he said.
As part of his push for more ethics in boardrooms, Jones touted the Goldman Sachs JUST US Large Cap ETF, which focuses on companies that comply with environmental, social and governance standards, or the so-called ESG investing philosophy.
The fund is up more than 8 percent so far in 2019, about in line with the broader stock market performance. The fund administrators rank Russell 1000 companies on how they stand regarding ESG metrics, then take the top companies and include them in the ETF. The top holdings include tech giants Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.
Jones is noted for making broad market calls and predicted the 1987 stock market crash. More recently, he warned at an investor forum in November of a ""global debt bubble"" that would be ""very challenging."" 
In June, he told CNBC that the stock market could go ""a lot higher at the end of the year,"" but the opposite happened. Stocks fell into a near-bear market to end the year as investors recoiled on fears that the Federal Reserve was going to make a policy mistake and raise rates too aggressively."

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. When it comes to underwear, men get the short end of the stick. We have basically three choices for this most intimate piece of apparel — the brief, the boxer, and the boxer brief — none of which is particularly exciting. While women's underwear can be functional, fetching, or both, men's underwear is more or less stuck at function. 
 Recently, I found a company that makes boxer briefs that function so well I've tossed out many of my older pairs. 
 Once you wear Saxx Underwear Co. boxer briefs, you, too, will probably thin the ranks in your underwear drawer, making room for new favorites. The only catch? The cheapest pair out there still costs about $25. 
SAXX Underwear 
Why the Ballpark Pouch makes all the difference:
 Cleverly albeit crassly named, the Ballpark Pouch is the most notable design element of a pair of Saxx boxer briefs, so let's start there. This is one of those ""why didn't they think of it before?"" innovations: two little flaps of fabric keep a man's legs and his business separated, and offer extra support to the latter. 
 The Ballpark Pouch prevents skin-on-skin contact and reduces friction, whether you're playing a heated game of ball, out for a jog, or just going about your daily routine. The pouch also helps prevent the buildup of moisture down there, reducing irritation, odor, and general annoyance. You guys know all about this — you probably shifted a bit in your chair just now, right? 
 And finally the pouch adds just a bit more lift and support, which you'll appreciate during athletic activity and leisure time alike. 
SAXX Underwear 
The fabric blend, perfected:
 Lots of boxer briefs are snug and supportive. Boxer briefs from Saxx are snug, and supportive, but also comfortable and nonrestrictive. You'll forget you're wearing them after a few seconds thanks to how well the blend of nylon, polyester, and spandex threads gently adhere to your body. The four-way stretch material moves with you, staying in place no matter how active you get. And it wicks away plenty of sweat, too, keeping you dry. 
 Flat seams and a wide 1.4-inch waist band finish off the fit, securing the underwear and ensuring your comfort. 
 And speaking of fabric, I know earlier I said that men's underwear aren't that exciting since in terms of styles and cuts and such, we really don't have as many options as women. But Saxx is at least ensuring that things down there are exciting as far as prints go. They offer boxer briefs in wild styles, from prints depicting a vibrant coral reef, to tie-dye, to jungle scenes. But don't worry, you can get striped or monochrome pairs, too.

Bottom line:
 I looked around and cheapest pair of Saxx boxer briefs I could find cost more than $20. And many sell for just over $55. 
 But I've been wearing my several pairs almost exclusively for months and they are still in perfect shape. So for my money, they're worth it. You spend all day in these things, treat yourself right down there."

Richard Barry, a former Toys R Us executive and now CEO of the new company called Tru Kids Brands, told The Associated Press he and his team are still working on the details, but they're exploring various options including freestanding stores and shops within existing stores. He says that e-commerce will play a key role.
Toys R Us, buckling under competition from Amazon and several billions of dollars of debt, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in September 2017 and then liquidated its businesses last year in the U.S. as well as several other regions including the United Kingdom.
In October, a group of investors won an auction for Toys R Us assets, believing they would do better by potentially reviving the toy chain, rather than selling it off for parts. Starting Jan. 20, Barry and several other former Toys R Us executives founded Tru Kids and are now managing the Toys R Us, Babies R Us and Geoffrey brands. Toys R Us generated $3 billion in global retail sales in 2018. Tru Kids estimates that 40 percent to 50 percent of Toys R Us market share is still up for grabs despite many retailers like Walmart and Target expanding their toy aisles.

""These brands are beloved by customers,"" said Barry. He noted that the company will focus on experiences in the physical stores, which could be about 10,000 square feet. The original Toys R Us stores were roughly about 40,000 square feet.
Barry said he and his team have been reaching out to toy makers and have received strong support. But he acknowledged that many had been burned by the Toys R Us liquidation.
Tru Kids, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, about a 20 minute drive from Wayne, New Jersey, where Toys R Us was based, will work with licensing partners to open 70 stores this year in Asia, India and Europe. Outside the U.S., Toys R Us continues to operate about 800 stores.

The Associated Press
Private investigators working for Jeff Bezos have concluded that the brother of the Amazon chief executives mistress leaked the couples intimate text messages to the National Enquirer, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press on Monday.
The person wasnt authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.
The findings add to the intrigue surrounding the clash between the pro-Trump tabloid and the worlds richest man. Mr. Bezoss investigators have suggested the Enquirers coverage of his affair was driven by dirty politics. U.S. President Donald Trump has been highly critical of Mr. Bezos over his ownership of The Washington Post and Amazon, and the Posts coverage of the White House.

The brother, Michael Sanchez, is a supporter of Mr. Trump and an acquaintance of Trump allies Roger Stone and Carter Page. He is also the manager of his sister, Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor. The investigators have not said how they believe Mr. Sanchez came into possession of his sisters intimate messages.
Mr. Sanchez did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. In a Jan. 31 tweet, he said without evidence that Mr. Bezoss long-time security consultant, Gavin de Becker, who is leading the private investigation, spreads fake, unhinged conservative conspiracy theories.
An attorney for the tabloids parent company did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
On Sunday, an attorney for the head of American Media Inc. (AMI), which owns the Enquirer, said that the information for the story had been provided by a reliable source well-known to Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez. The source had provided information to the company for at least seven years, Elkan Abromowitz, an attorney for AMI chief executive David Pecker, said on ABCs This Week.
When asked if Mr. Sanchez was the source, Mr. Abromowitz said: Im not permitted to tell you or confirm or deny who the source is.
But the Daily Beast, citing people inside AMI, reported that Mr. Sanchez was the Enquirers source.
Mr. Bezos ordered the investigation after the Enquirer published a story about the affair last month. The investigators have since turned over the results of their probe to attorney Richard Ben-Veniste for review and possible referral to law enforcement. Mr. Ben-Veniste had served as special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal.

Mr. Bezos has said AMI threatened to publish explicit photos of him unless he stopped investigating how the Enquirer obtained his private exchanges, and publicly declared that the Enquirers coverage of him was not politically motivated.
Federal prosecutors are also looking into whether the Enquirer violated a co-operation and non-prosecution agreement that recently spared the tabloid and top executives from charges for paying hush money to a Playboy model who claimed she had an affair with Mr. Trump, two people familiar with the matter said. The people werent authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity."

Customers who dislike do-it-yourself chores will now be able to walk up to store associates at any of the 90 Crate and Barrel stores across the country and arrange for a Handy worker to come to their home between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., any day of the week, to complete the task. 
The Northbrook, Illinois-based retailer was expected to announce the partnership later on Monday. The decision is the latest example of a big box retailer responding to new online competition by offering a range of services complementing its furniture assortment. 
Odd-jobs site Task Rabbit, a rival of Handy, was bought by Swedish furniture giant IKEA in September 2017. Determined to win over online shoppers, IKEA told Reuters it was expanding into interior design and looking at services such as furniture repair to gain an edge. 
For now, Crate and Barrel customers will only be able to book a Handy worker while physically in the store and Handy installation is not currently available for Crate and Barrel products purchased online, a Handy spokesperson said. 
Prices for the handyman services range from $59 to $199, a Handy spokesperson said. Hanging wall art, for example, costs $65. Desk assembly costs $109. 
This is the first time Crate and Barrel is doing business with Handy, which also offers home services such as furniture assembly and television mounting via partnerships with retailers Walmart, Wayfair Inc and eBay Inc. 
Separately, Walmart Inc on Friday debuted an online-exclusive furniture brand dubbed “MoDRN” and said in a company blog post it would launch new furniture and decor seasonally. 
Over the past year, Walmart has seen a nearly 35 percent increase in visits to its home destination, with most customers spending more time on the site, according to the post. 
The companies did not reveal financial terms of the partnership.

Maybe it's the LA smog somehow polluting the screen of my iPad— but it's more likely to be general residue collecting on the screen when my iPad spends the day in my too-old backpack. 
 Regardless, when I sit down to work and my iPad screen is dirty, it's just distracting. At some point, I have a strong suspicion that there will be research proving that we're more productive when our device screens are clean. (Up until now, no comprehensive research has been conducted on the subject, so you'll have to trust my hunch on this one.) 
 In hopes of becoming less distracted by a dirty screen, I try to clean my iPad screen with some regularity. However, you need to be careful when cleaning any device screen. It's not something you can spray Windex on and hope for the best. That's why we're going to cover how to clean an iPad screen and what not to do when cleaning an iPad. 
What to avoid when cleaning your iPad screen
 Your iPad may seem unbreakable, but it's still a fragile electronic. And that means it is easily damaged and needs to be handled with care — and without moisture. Here's what you need to avoid when cleaning your iPad screen: 
Using sprays of any kind. In fact, Apple Support advises that you ""don't use aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives."" Apple also reminds users of its devices to not ""get moisture into any openings"" of a device. 
Leaving your device plugged in. You'll also want to make sure there aren't any power cables attached to your iPad while you're cleaning, according to Apple. 
Using paper towels, hand towels, or any other abrasive cloths. If it feels like you shouldn't use it on your iPad screen, trust that instinct. Apple says to ""avoid abrasive cloths, towels, paper towels, and similar items that might cause damage."" 
How to clean an iPad screen properly
Using a microfiber cleaning cloth is a great move.
 Maya Kachroo-Levine/Business Insider 
Make sure your device is unplugged. 
 Turn your iPad to ""sleep"" mode or power the iPad off entirely.

 With small circular motions, use the soft cloth to clean the iPad screen. 
 If necessary, dampen the cloth (ever so slightly) with water. If you're going to dampen the cloth, use extra caution so you don't risk moisture entering the cracks of the iPad.

Either way, remember to not spray the liquid directly on the screen, but rather apply the liquid to the cloth before cleaning the screen with small circular motions. 
 Do not use the damp cloth along the perimeter of the iPad. Only a completely dry, lint-free cloth should be used to clean the screen's perimeter."

that things have taken a turn for the worse  So much more is the case when it comes to companies When they stop disclosing certain numbers they were all too happy to share in the past theres a good chance its because those figures no longer put them in the best light and may actually highlight the fact that something is going seriously wrong with their business  The tech industry of late has provided three highprofile examples of this truism  In recent months Apple Facebook and Twitter each announced that they would no longer be reporting a key figure analysts and investors have used to track their businesses In each case the change not only threatens to make the companys results more opaque but it also seems to be an attempt to hide something unflattering about the firms underlying performance  Apple stopped reporting iPhone unit sales just before they plunged  Apple of course is the most notorious case of the three In November it alerted investors and analysts that it would no longer report the number of iPhones or other devices it sold each quarter  Companywatchers had long scrutinized the figures particularly for iPhone sales seeing them as an important indicator of demand for Apples products their share of their markets and the relative success of the companys business But Luca Maestri the companys chief financial officer said Apples competitors dont disclose their unit sales figures and he argued that the numbers arent necessarily representative of the health of its business Luca Maestri Apples chief financial officer argued that its iPhone sales no longer indicated the health of its business Apple Apple is in new lines of business such as its collection of services that dont depend directly on the number of devices it sells he said It also now offers devices at a wide range of price points he said the sale of a 1000 iPhone X is obviously much more meaningful to its revenue than a 450 iPhone 7 but both would could as one unit sold  Investors and even some analysts immediately saw through that line of reasoning The number of iPhones Apple sold barely grew in its 2018 fiscal year and Apple watchers worried that the companys real reason for ceasing its unitsales reports was because it figured its iPhone sales were about to start to decline Apples stock dropped 7 on the news  Those fears were soon validated Within a couple weeks of Apples announcement the first reports started trickling out that it was seeing weak demand for its latest phones and was already starting to cut production Although company officials initially tried to

financial results Read thisHey Tim Cook theres a simple solution to your iPhone sales problem Now analysts  working admittedly with much less data than they used to have  are forecasting a big drop in iPhone sales this year and potentially further declines on into the future  Theyre also refuting the notion that unit sales are no longer important to Apples business arguing convincingly that even the revenue the company gets from its services is closely tied to the number of iPhones it sells given that so many of those services are exclusive to Apple devices With iPhone sales expected to decline many are now reducing their expectations for Apples service business  Facebook and Twitter investors should be concerned  The Apple experience is instructive for investors and analysts hoping to make sense of similar moves by Twitter and Facebook Both companies announced they would no longer disclose certain numbers about their respective user bases Each attempted to justify the move by

financial officer said merely that the daily number and its growth were the best ways to measure our success  But like Apple with the iPhone sales figure Twitter had good reason to mask the monthly user number  its been falling After declining for three straight quarters the company had 321 million monthly users in the holiday period That was the least number of monthly users it had had since the end of 2016 and was down 4 since the first quarter  Not to worry Twitter officials essentially said Its daily user count has been growing consistently for years now  That may be the case but the daily usage figure is problematic for multiple reasons One of them is that the number is relatively small  just 126 million At least nominally thats 48 fewer than the number who use Snapchat on a daily basis And its less than 10 of Facebooks daily user base  A second shortcoming is that Twitter says the number isnt necessarily comparable to other companies daily usage figures and isnt determined by any standardized industry methodology That makes it kind of a black box  who knows how Twitter is actually calculating it It also means that investors cant directly compare Twitters performance with those of its socialnetworking peers  Another problem with the figure is that it gives a very narrow window to view Twitters usage It would be best to be able to use it in tandem with the monthly figure to get a sense of how well Twitter is doing growing its overall user base and convincing them to use the site more regularly Like Apple shareholders Twitter investors didnt seem thrilled with the change The companys stock dropped nearly 10 on the day of its report even though its results beat Wall Streets expectations  Facebook is still reporting its usage numbers  for now

fourth quarter of 2016 monthly usage was growing at nearly a 17 annual clip and daily usage was growing by more 18  The broader figure will likely obscure that flagging performance Thats a problem

(AP) It has been almost four years since former Valley Tech softball star Bella Picard fractured her neck diving into second base in the first inning of a game at Fordham during her sophomore season at St. Joseph's University.
""I'm not sick of telling my story,"" Picard said during a recent interview at her family's home.
Picard lost feeling and movement on the right side of her body when her fifth cervical vertebra (C5) was broken. In the last 45 months, she has undergone numerous surgeries, dealt with complications of C5 spinal injuries, like two bouts of pneumonia and autonomic dysreflexia (sudden onset of high blood pressure), which caused her to black out, as well as a right knee issue.
She continues to rehab on an outpatient basis at Spaulding Rehabilitation in Framingham, and in Florida, where she lives part of the year with her grandmother. Picard has found the warm weather very beneficial.
Through it all, Picard, 23, has remained determined, defiant, confident, inspiring and unwavering in her faith.
She has progressed from wheelchair to walker to cane to yes! walking on her own. She remains paralyzed below her right knee her lovable yellow Lab, Benny, drops her three lower-leg braces on her bed every morning but has regained a little bit of plantar flexion in her right foot. Always a workout devotee, Picard's cropped shirt revealed her sculpted arms and abs.
""In some aspects (I'm ahead of where doctors thought I would be),"" Picard said. ""I kept progressing last year and they were like, 'Oh, yeah. Maybe we should get her to journey forward, get her running.' Then my knee started happening. Then they say, 'Maybe she's plateaued. Maybe this is the best it will get.' That's their professional medical opinion and that's where I'm like, 'Nah. Nah. Nah.' ""
Picard focuses on the future and on hopefully getting her own apartment in Florida soon ""I'm almost independent,"" she said.
She also recently revisited the past. It was a powerful, emotional and enduring moment, and another part of the healing process as she moves forward.
In the first inning of the first game of St. Joseph's doubleheader against Fordham on April 18, 2015, Picard reached on a one-out single. On a hit-and-run play, she took off for second base. As she went to slide head first and Fordham shortstop Allie Bradian came across to cover, both at full speed, Picard's head and Bradian's knee collided.
Picard was knocked out and taken to the hospital.
""This is what you see in a football game, not on a softball field,"" Bradian recalled of that chilling instant.
After the games, Bradian walked over to the nearby Walgreens to get Picard a card. They didn't know each other, so Bradian wasn't sure what to write, but she gave the card to the St. Joe's coach the next day. No details of Picard's condition had been made public yet.
""I don't remember when I officially realized, 'This is bad,' "" Bradian said. ""It was just sitting in my heart really heavy.""
Time went on, their lives went on.
Bradian, a pre-med student at Fordham, sent Picard a couple more notes and a Christmas card in 2017.
""Something sparked in me like, 'Wait, this might be something God is pointing at,' "" Picard said.
They soon connected on Facebook, talked on the phone and set up a time to meet, on April 18, the three-year anniversary of the accident, at Fordham's field.
""It was like a movie,"" Picard said. ""It was pouring rain. It was just us and we were like, 'We're really doing this.' ""
The field was covered in tarp.
""The first thing I said to Allie is that's so symbolic,"" Picard said. ""(What happened) is dead and buried. We both started crying.
""She said, 'I just have to say that I'm sorry,' "" Picard said, ""and I was like, 'Oh, my gosh. Stop.' But for her, for me to forgive her, she needed that. That was healing for her.""
""I did need that forgiveness from her,"" Bradian said. ""Once I got it from her, I needed to forgive myself. I know it wasn't my fault, but at times life happens, you get busy and I think I just needed to forgive myself for forgetting at times. I couldn't forgive myself because I just felt like I wasn't living my life good enough for what had happened and what didn't happen to me.""
Honestly, Picard said, there was nothing to forgive.
""All those cards and with everything she was doing,"" Picard said, ""if I could go back and tell her, 'Hey, I'm probably not going to talk to you much because life is pretty crazy, but I'm making this full recovery for you. We're going to do this.' If I could go back and say that, I think that would have helped her with her feelings over the years.""
Picard and Bradian have become close friends.
""God is working in our lives every day,"" said Bradian, 25, of East Greenwich, New Jersey, who was visiting Picard last Friday, ""but it takes a really strong person to forgive to such an extremity where most people would get bitter. For her not to is just amazing. We talk all the time and if we were in each other's shoes we would be doing the same thing.""
Her meeting with Bradian and their new-found friendship is the inspiration for Picard's new video series #BRINGBACKTHERIGHTSIDEDIARY.
Picard and Bradian made the video in November and December on ballfields here and near Bradian's house in New Jersey. They played catch for the first time.
Each chapter of the diary will feature an amazing person Picard has met since the accident that has made a significant impact on her life.
Chapter 2, which is near completion, is about Meredith Koch, the first friend Picard made during her two-month stay at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. Denna Laing, the former professional ice hockey player who suffered a spinal cord injury in the 2016 Outdoor Women's Classic, and Eric LeGrand, the former Rutgers football player who was paralyzed while making a tackle in a 2010 game, are planned for future chapters.
""The series had been in my head,"" Picard said, ""and then becoming friends with Allie it was God saying, 'Do it.'

The 34-year-old singer and clothing designer has pulled two Perry-branded shoes from online stores, following complaints that their designs resembled blackface makeup.
According to USA Today, the two designsthe Rue Face slip-on loafer, and the Ora Face sandalwere yanked from the clothing line’s official website on Monday. Both items feature eyes, a nose, and a mouth set against an all-black background, and each retailed for $129.
Not long after the items disappeared from Perry’s site, they were removed from the online stores of multiple retailers, including Walmart and Dillards, according to TMZ. The site noted the singer’s company was in the process of pulling the shoes from the market entirely.
The shoes had been decried on social media, with singer Masika Kalysha, who has more than 2 million Instagram followers, reportedly posting a photo of the shoes on the site over the weekend, adding, “We just gonna let Katy Perry slide?”
The outcry comes during a period that’s seen the fashion industry scramble to deal with charges of racial insensitivity. Last week, Gucci issued a public apology for an $890 sweater that was attacked by critics for resembling blackface.

Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio reached to lure
Amazon.com Inc.
to Queens. The company has agreed to bring 25,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood, where it plans to build a campus in exchange for $3 billion in state and city tax incentives. Local criticism of the deal has prompted Amazon executives to re-evaluate the project, people familiar with the matter said last week. State tax breaks and other incentives, such as grants and capital spending, increased 28% between 2016 and 2018 to nearly $4.4 billion, according to the report by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit civic organization. Incentives from municipal and county governments grew at a slower pace of about 9% in the same period, to about $5.6 billion.
Riley Edwards, a research associate for the commission, said it isnt clear whether New Yorkers have gotten a good deal from corporate tax incentives. She said the state should build a public database that compiles economic-development incentive data from local, county and state programs.
Theres not really a centralized source of information on these things, Ms. Edwards said. Instead of looking at what were spending and making sure were getting what we want to get out of it, this number just keeps increasing.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said New Yorks recent job growth shows the Democratic governors economic-development approach is working. Mr. Cuomos office will discuss with state lawmakers in coming weeks several proposals to strengthen oversight and transparency around tax breaks, including a searchable database of deals that receive state incentives, the spokesman said.
New York has approved state tax breaks for a variety of programs ranging from tax credits for cleaning up and redeveloping old industrial sites to incentives for film and commercial productions.
Some of the big-ticket projects that have been approved for state economic-development spending over the last two years include Moynihan Station in Manhattan, which is part of the Penn Station revamp, and Mr. Cuomos ongoing Buffalo Billion public-private development project. More than half of the estimated $5.6 billion in local incentive spending has been concentrated in New York City, according to the report.
In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has proposed scaling back corporate tax breaks. The state awarded nearly $11 billion in incentives to companies between 1996 and February 2018, according to a recently released audit by the state comptrollers office. Lawmakers are examining corporate incentives before two of the states biggest tax-credit programs expire this summer.

kind of counter balance to that Fast forward to where we are today and we now have the highest wealth inequality in the history of this country Weve got literally half the country that cant raise 1000 for a family emergency We have got  35 of the wealth used to be owned by the lowest 90 of the population  the lowest  bottom 90 of the population in 1985 Today the bottom 90 of the population owns 23 of the wealth So they have lost a third And that 12 has gone to the top 1 So weve got a system that I think we all could agree on the wrong trackBOB PISANI Youre going to share a slide with the people here that I think is fascinating JUST Capital firm  youre very involved with youve helped foundPAUL TUDOR JONES FoundationBOB PISANI Foundation excuse me You helped foundPAUL TUDOR JONES RightBOB PISANI Has very different principles in maximizing shareholder return You went to the American public surveyed them and they had very different values about what a corporation should be doing to maximize shareholder return They said 25 of the corporation should be doing is making sure workers get fair pay and benefits 20 say customer treatment of privacy are essentially Products should be socially beneficial 15 say Look at this And good for the environment 13 I want to put up the next one because only  respondents felt that only about 9 of the real purpose of a company 8 excuse me should be to maximize investor returns Thats old the Milton Friedman Friedman said 100 Your point is the American public is already socially responsible How do you get them to change the attitude How do you go to a boardroom of investors and tell them No no Adopt this model Dont adopt Milton FriedmanPAUL TUDOR JONES So here are the facts The facts are since 2008 92 of corporate profits gone to shareholders Its the exact photo negative of what the American public thinks a just company should do So we have this big disconnect of what the American public thinks and what corporate boardrooms the Csuite are actually doing The interesting thing is theres a way to bridge that gap where everyone wins So what JUST Capital does is we rank the Russell 1000 companies 1 to 1000 every year according to those metrics not determined by us are an academic panel but by the American public Weve polled over 100000 people over 4 years So this is what the American public thinks We rank those companies 1 to 1000 We created an ETF which is why Im here that takes in the 33 industries that track the Russell 1000 it takes the top half the top performing of those 33 sectors and we have an ETF that has half the names of the Russell the best performing on those metrics according to the American public that are important That index on so many metrics outperforms the rest of the companiesBOB PISANI Now that symbol PAUL TUDOR JONES It outperforms stock prices better It outperforms the Just index It outperforms the Russell 1000 On average those companies create jobs that are 27 faster rate Has a 3 higher return on equity Recycles waste nine times the average I could go on and onBOB PISANI That symbol is JUST that ETF youre talking about You talk a lot about wealth inequality Is there a connection here Do you think if corporations address the issues and started adopting the kind of values youre espousing here that that would help address the wealth inequality problem Is there a connection herePAUL TUDOR JONES Clearly there is a connection I think we have got a mania going on in buybacks and a mania going on in terms of shareholder primacy It wasnt always that way Right If we go back to when I was a youngster corporate pay CEOs made 20 times that of the average line worker So things have been different and can be different again And if theyre not Im really nervous about what the ultimate social consequences are in this countryBOB PISANI Well Senator Schumer and Sanders introduced a bill to limit buybacks recently Do you support thatPAUL TUDOR JONES Well Ive been talking with Senator Schumer on justness for over a year I dont know if I want to see a legislative outcome for this Id love to see this happen organically If I was and Im not if I was a director on a public company or a private company forprofit company theres two questions I would ask before I even thought about shareholder buybacks dividends or anything The first question would be how many of my employees are not making a living wage Thats the first question that I would ask The second one if I were a director I would ask is what are we doing to help local communities What percentage charitable contribution is going to the most needy and the place where we have customers What are we doing So in 1985 charitable contributions by companies were 2 of revenues Today its 1 Why is that Why is thatBOB PISANI Let me just move on Lets go to the taxing wealth question that weve had in general  we have seen a spade of democratic hopefuls announce recently How do you feel about the new democratic proposals for taxing wealthPAUL TUDOR JONES Well I think the reason that we started JUST is so that we wouldnt get to this point right If I think about the taxes it is the most inefficient way to allocate resources within an economy So thats why I think JUST Capital is so important Id like to find an organic solution and that means a complete cultural social intellectual shift of the way that we think about our companies and what their responsibilities are Why dont they have greater social responsibilities The smartest people in the world run American companies Let them  lets bring them into this discussion on how we take care of those left behindBOB PISANI Ive got to move on and ask you about the global economy and about the markets Obviously people here  global growth is the major issue Can you just a give us you brief overview of the markets What do you think of the United States markets right now Europe and China right nowPAUL TUDOR JONES Im very bullish on the US stock market If you think about what happened last year last year we I think of things in terms of flows and last year we walked into a situation with a lot of euphoria A huge amount of investor positioning long equities Both in the United States and globally And we took those positions and pretty much washed them into a trillion dollars of corporate buybacks Fast forward to where we are today all that leverage positioning in particular from the long short community the macro community the discretionary asset managers thats all been washed out But we still have like the Terminator 1 trillion plus in buybacks probably scheduled  well certainly globally and maybe close to that even in the United States I dont know where the stocks going to come from It will have to be I think higher prices defined a group of investors willing to sell their stocksBOB PISANI Europe EU last week essentially flat growth in Italy going nowhere 1 at best for the rest of Europe right now Is there any kind of relative value play given how Europe has underperformed What do how should our viewers feel about EuropePAUL TUDOR JONES So again right So I think we are going to have  I think this year we are going to continue to have US exceptionalism and US outperformance And I think the SampP 500 will outperform its peers it will outperform emerging markets And I think from that youll have to take all the correlated trades So I think rates wont go down Theyll probably go back up And I think the dollar will probably stay firmBOB PISANI Okay Paul Tudor Jones its a very timely topic youve got about wealth inequality and ways to address it Well follow JUST Capital and Im going to go in with you and watch your speech Thank you for joining usPAUL TUDOR JONES And dont forget the ETF dont

WHERE: CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Live from the Inside ETFs Conference
The following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with Billionaire Investor Paul Tudor Jones Speaks with CNBC's Bob Pisani on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" (M-F 3PM 5PM) today, Monday, February 11th. The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/02/11/tudor-jones-we-have-a-mania-going-on-in-buybacks.html.
All references must be sourced to CNBC.
SARA EISEN: The world's largest ETF conference is currently under way in Florida. Our own Bob Pisani is there and he is joined by legendary hedge fund manager and Tudor Investment founder Paul Tudor Jones. It is a CNBC exclusive. Bob, take it away.
BOB PISANI: And we're here at the biggest ETF conference in the world, Sara. 2,500 investment professionals talking about the future outlook for global growth and of course, investing in general. Paul, thanks very much for joining us. You are about to give a major speech on, let's call it social responsible investing. ESG, environment social governance, in general. Your point is an interesting one. You're telling the crowd: It's time for the American investing public to change their outlook on how and what they believe the purpose of corporations are. The old Milton Friedman model. You argue that the purpose of a corporation is to maximize shareholder returns is an outmoded one. Why and what do you want to replace it with?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Well, you have to realize when Milton Friedman said that, and he was always a hero of mine, that was in 1970. The top income tax rate had been 90%, had just come to 70. Wealth inequality was one fifth of what it is today. So we were living in that semi socialist state in that point of time. And so, he was the kind of counter balance to that. Fast forward to where we are today, and we now have the highest wealth inequality in the history of this country. We've got literally half the country that can't raise $1,000 for a family emergency. We have got -- 35% of the wealth used to be owned by the lowest 90% of the population -- the lowest -- bottom 90% of the population in 1985. Today the bottom 90% of the population owns 23% of the wealth. So they have lost a third. And that 12% has gone to the top 1%. So we've got a system that I think we all could agree on the wrong track.
BOB PISANI: You're going to share a slide with the people here that I think is fascinating. JUST Capital firm -- you're very involved with you've helped found.
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Foundation.
BOB PISANI: Foundation, excuse me. You helped found.
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Right.
BOB PISANI: Has very different principles in maximizing shareholder return. You went to the American public, surveyed them, and they had very different values about what a corporation should be doing to maximize shareholder return. They said 25% of the corporation should be doing is making sure workers get fair pay and benefits. 20% say customer treatment of privacy are essentially. Products should be socially beneficial, 15% say. Look at this. And good for the environment, 13%. I want to put up the next one because only -- respondents felt that only about 9% of the real purpose of a company, 8%, excuse me, should be to maximize investor returns. That's old the Milton Friedman Friedman said 100%. Your point is the American public is already socially responsible. How do you get them to change the attitude? How do you go to a boardroom of investors and tell them: ""No, no. Adopt this model. Don't adopt Milton Friedman,""?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: So here are the facts. The facts are, since 2008, 92% of corporate profits gone to shareholders. It's the exact photo negative of what the American public thinks a ""just company should do. So we have this big disconnect of what the American public thinks and what corporate boardrooms, the C-suite, are actually doing. The interesting thing is there's a way to bridge that gap where everyone wins. So what JUST Capital does is we rank the Russell 1000 companies 1 to 1,000 every year according to those metrics, not determined by us are an academic panel but by the American public. We've polled over 100,000 people over 4 years. So this is what the American public thinks. We rank those companies 1 to 1,000. We created an ETF, which is why I'm here, that takes in the 33 industries that track the Russell 1,000, it takes the top half, the top performing of those 33 sectors and we have an ETF that has half the names of the Russell, the best performing on those metrics, according to the American public, that are important. That index on so many metrics outperforms the rest of the companies.
BOB PISANI: Now, that symbol 
PAUL TUDOR JONES: It outperforms stock prices better. It outperforms the Just index. It outperforms the Russell 1,000. On average those companies create jobs that are 27% faster rate. Has a 3% higher return on equity. Recycles waste nine times the average. I could go on and on.
BOB PISANI: That symbol is JUST, that ETF you're talking about. You talk a lot about wealth inequality. Is there a connection here? Do you think if corporations address the issues and started adopting the kind of values you're espousing here, that that would help address the wealth inequality problem? Is there a connection here?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Clearly there is a connection. I think we have got a mania going on in buybacks and a mania going on in terms of shareholder primacy. It wasn't always that way. Right? If we go back to when I was a youngster, corporate pay, CEOs made 20 times that of the average line worker. So things have been different and can be different again. And if they're not, I'm really nervous about what the ultimate social consequences are in this country.
BOB PISANI: Well Senator Schumer and Sanders introduced a bill to limit buybacks recently. Do you support that?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Well I've been talking with Senator Schumer on justness for over a year. I don't know if I want to see a legislative outcome for this. I'd love to see this happen organically. If I was, and I'm not, if I was a director on a public company or a private company, for-profit company, there's two questions I would ask before I even thought about shareholder buybacks, dividends or anything. The first question would be: how many of my employees are not making a living wage? That's the first question that I would ask. The second one, if I were a director I would ask is: what are we doing to help local communities? What percentage charitable contribution is going to the most needy and the place where we have customers? What are we doing? So, in 1985, charitable contributions by companies were 2% of revenues. Today it's 1%. Why is that? Why is that?
BOB PISANI: Let me just move on. Let's go to the taxing wealth question that we've had in general -- we have seen a spade of democratic hopefuls announce recently. How do you feel about the new democratic proposals for taxing wealth?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Well I think the reason that we started JUST is so that we wouldn't get to this point, right? If I think about the taxes, it is the most inefficient way to allocate resources within an economy. So that's why I think JUST Capital is so important. I'd like to find an organic solution and that means a complete cultural, social, intellectual shift of the way that we think about our companies and what their responsibilities are. Why don't they have greater social responsibilities? The smartest people in the world run American companies. Let them -- let's bring them into this discussion on how we take care of those left behind.
BOB PISANI: I've got to move on and ask you about the global economy and about the markets. Obviously people here -- global growth is the major issue. Can you just a give us you brief overview of the markets. What do you think of the United States markets right now? Europe and China right now?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: I'm very bullish on the U.S. stock market. If you think about what happened last year, last year we I think of things in terms of flows, and last year we walked into a situation with a lot of euphoria. A huge amount of investor positioning long equities. Both in the United States and globally. And we took those positions and pretty much washed them into a trillion dollars of corporate buybacks. Fast forward to where we are today, all that leverage positioning in particular from the long short community, the macro community, the discretionary asset managers, that's all been washed out. But we still have, like the Terminator, 1 trillion plus in buybacks probably scheduled -- well, certainly globally and maybe close to that even in the United States. I don't know where the stock's going to come from. It will have to be I think higher prices defined, a group of investors willing to sell their stocks.
BOB PISANI: Europe, EU last week, essentially flat growth in Italy going nowhere, 1% at best for the rest of Europe right now. Is there any kind of relative value play given how Europe has underperformed? What do how should our viewers feel about Europe?
PAUL TUDOR JONES: So again right. So I think we are going to have -- I think this year we are going to continue to have U.S. exceptionalism and U.S. outperformance. And I think the S&amp;P 500 will outperform its peers, it will outperform emerging markets. And I think from that, you'll have to take all the correlated trades. So I think rates won't go down. They'll probably go back up. And I think the dollar will probably stay firm.
BOB PISANI: Okay. Paul Tudor Jones, it's a very timely topic you've got about wealth inequality and ways to address it. We'll follow JUST Capital, and I'm going to go in with you and watch your speech. Thank you for joining us.
PAUL TUDOR JONES: And don't forget the ETF, don't forget it.
BOB PISANI: J-U-S-T.
PAUL TUDOR JONES: Yeah that's the index and the ETF is J-U-L-C-D.
BOB PISANI: J-U-L-C-D. Thank you very much. Paul Tudor Jones, always a pleasure here. I'm here today and tomorrow. The biggest ETF Conference in the world. We will have a lot of other guests we'll be talking about, as well. Sara, back to you.

The company that publishes the National Enquirer was concerned enough that it may have acted as an agent of Saudi Arabia that it asked the Justice Department last year whether it needed to register as a foreign lobbyist, a person with knowledge of Saudi Arabia's lobbying efforts in the U.S. confirms to NBC News.
Communications between the Justice Department and American Media Inc. offer the fullest picture to date of interactions between the tabloid publisher and the Saudis ahead of AMI's release last year of a fawning magazine about Saudi Arabia's young leader. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who has accused AMI of blackmailing him with intimate photos, has questioned whether Saudi Arabia may have been involved, a claim the kingdom denies.
A July 2018 letter from Justice Department lawyers to AMI and posted to a government website shows that the Justice Department's National Security Division ultimately told the publisher that, based on AMI's own statements, it did not need to register. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people or entities that work to advance a foreign country's political interests in the U.S. must disclose their specific activities and register as foreign lobbyists.
""Taking into account the facts stated in your submission, and limiting our evaluation only to the facts stated in your submission, we find that there is no agency relationship between [U.S. corporation] and any foreign principal,"" the Justice Department wrote, referring to AMI.
Although the names of the parties are redacted in the publicly released version of the letter, the timing, facts and circumstances all line up precisely with AMI's unusual publication of the magazine about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his March 2018 visit to the United States. The person familiar with Saudi Arabia's lobbying efforts confirmed to NBC News that AMI and the Saudi government are the entities referred to in the letter, which was first disclosed Monday by The Wall Street Journal.
American Media Inc. (AMI) headquarter building in New York on Feb. 7, 2019.Jeenah Moon / Reuters
AMI produced the glossy magazine last year just ahead of a whirlwind tour of the U.S. by Crown Prince Mohammed, who at the time was not a household name in the U.S. The magazine was sold on newsstands for $13.99, including in many rural states, and had no advertisements, raising questions about why AMI thought it would be a money-maker for the company.
At the time, AMI said that Saudi Arabia had played no role in production of the magazine, even when it was revealed that the Saudi Embassy in Washington had been given an advance copy of the magazine weeks before it hit newsstands.
But in its letters to the Justice Department in May and June 2018, AMI acknowledged that it had asked a Saudi adviser to submit content for the magazine, given the adviser an early draft to review and then made changes to the final version that were suggested by the Saudi adviser.
According to the Justice Department letter, government lawyers determined that AMI didn't need to register as a Saudi agent based on AMI's claims that it received no foreign funding for the magazine and that it had been under no obligation to make the changes suggested by the Saudi adviser. The identity of the adviser mentioned is unclear.
AMI's potential ties to Saudi Arabia are under scrutiny after Bezos, in his Medium post accusing AMI of trying to blackmail him, raised the possibility that Saudi Arabia had been involved either in giving AMI the ""intimate text messages"" or in inducing AMI to target and humiliate him. Bezos specifically raised the example of AMI's pro-Saudi magazine to point out that there have long been questions about whether its reporting is influenced by ""external forces.""
Bezos wrote that a top AMI official had recently told him and his lawyers that AMI's CEO, David Pecker, was ""apoplectic"" that Bezos had launched a private investigation into how AMI got his text messages.
""For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,"" Bezos wrote.
Pecker, through his lawyer, has said that Saudi Arabia was not the source of the text messages obtained by The National Enquirer, though AMI has declined to identify the source.
""The clear threat from Bezos' point of view is that we're going to link you to Saudi Arabia, we're going to say that you hacked all of these texts, we're going to slander the publication as much as we can,"" Pecker's lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said Sunday on ABC""s ""This Week.""
Saudi Arabia, too, has pushed back on the suggestion from Bezos that it was involved in leaking his emails.
""As far as I know, flat no,"" Saudi State Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters Friday at the Saudi Embassy in Washington. Offering his own assessment of the situation, he added, ""It's a soap opera.""

In October, a group of investors won an auction for Toys R Us assets, believing they would do better by potentially reviving the toy chain rather than selling it off for parts.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Specifically, traders who bet against stocks like Nike and Starbucks when talks go south usually assuming that they'll be boycotted because they're distinctly American brands could have ""the China trade"" all wrong, he told investors.
""This earnings season has revealed some brutal truths about 'the China trade' that just don't jive with the ... conventional wisdom,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money."" ""We act like the winners and the losers from the trade war are obvious, but the reality's a lot more nuanced than that. Many companies that should be hurting in the People's Republic have been putting up some astonishing numbers, while others are being torn to pieces by increased competition or the slowing Chinese economy.""
White House officials have confused Wall Street with their statements on the trade talks in recent months, at times signaling progress and at times suggesting that the two sides were still far from reaching an agreement.
As a result, short-term stock-pickers have had to follow their instincts, Cramer explained. When tensions seem to be rising, they'll usually choose to short-sell shares of top consumer brands, capital goods companies and technology giants, he said. Short-selling involves trying to profit on a bet that a company's shares will decline in the near future.
Nike, Starbucks, Estee Lauder and Yum China all tend to fall in the first short-selling bucket, but if you ask the ""Mad Money"" host, that strategy ""just hasn't paid off.""
""Nike and Starbucks both reported an acceleration in sales"" this quarter, he noted, adding that Nike saw its best-ever Singles Day, China's Black-Friday-esque shopping holiday. ""Nike's biggest problem in the PRC? High-quality problem: making enough shoes to meet the demand.""
Starbucks performed strongly, with higher-than-expected same-store sales in China. Estee Lauder's earnings report had nary a hair on it. And while Yum China didn't blow away the estimates with its results, they weren't nearly as bad as many had feared, with rising revenues to boot.
""The consumer stocks that are holding up in China ... all share one trait: they have unassailable brands with little Chinese competiton,"" Cramer said. ""There's really nothing like Starbucks in the PRC yet. Yum China? KFC slowed, [but] not enough to give the short-sellers a win. Estee Lauder's practically peerless.""
Capital goods companies told a different story this earnings season: Emerson Electric, United Technologies, 3M and Caterpillar were all impacted by their exposure to the economic slowdown in China.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing was the only exception, Cramer said, calling its much better-than-expected earnings results ""a glorious secular win."" Even though it sells one in four planes to Chinese buyers, ""the Chinese need Boeing more than Boeing needs China,"" he explained.
In the technology space, ""the elephant in the room is Apple,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The iPhone maker pre-announced some first-quarter weakness tied to China in early January, and while it managed to top expectations later in the month, it sent a whole host of stocks including that of its supplier, Skyworks Solutions down with it.
""Tech's the real triumph for the short-sellers, because the Chinese government has made it difficult for Apple to do well [it's considered] cheaper, more patriotic, if you go buy the Huawei phone,"" Cramer said. ""Nvidia's been crushed by a government-mandated slowdown in Chinese gaming.""
So, if you're trying to invest around developments in U.S.-China trade talks, going against the daily grain might be your best move, Cramer said.
""If this market gets hammered on China fears later this week and I expect it will use that pullback to buy ... Nike, Starbucks, Estee Lauder, and Yum China, not to mention Boeing,"" he advised. ""Be wary of the industrials with Chinese exposure, and expect pain in the techs with Chinese business. Sure, there are some wildcards, but now you have your cheat sheet and a much better sense of who's being hurt and who's doing just fine.""

That, according to data reported by The Posts Chris Ingraham last week, means that those 160 million people now have about $2 for every $3 held by the richest 400 Americans.
Not the richest 400 million Americans. The richest 400 Americans as individuals, who have 50 percent more of the countrys wealth than those 160 million who make up the bottom 60 percent of the country in terms of wealth.
That disparity, which sees the richest 0.1 percent of the country holding more wealth than the bottom 80 percent, has become a recurring theme in American politics, from the Occupy Wall Street movement of nearly a decade ago to more recent policy proposals from prominent Democrats aimed at addressing the divide with a highly specific tool: taxes.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced a new tax on the richest Americans last month, independent of the income tax. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) referred to the possibility of raising the top tax rate to 70 percent on income over $10 million last month, spurring any number of conversations about raising taxes on the very wealthy.
Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, a member of the latter class and a possible independent presidential candidate, insists that such a move is not what America wants. Hes mostly incorrect about that, given that polls generally show support for Ocasio-Cortezs idea. But more broadly, polls consistently show supporting for raising taxes on the wealthy in general terms.
CNN recently polled on both Ocasio-Cortezs proposal and, in vague terms, Warrens. Surprisingly, the new tax of 70 percent on income over $10 million was more unpopular than popular, except among Democrats. The general tax on those earning $50 million or more saw broader support.
That view of Ocasio-Cortezs proposal didnt match other polls. Fox News, for example, asked Americans whether they supported raising taxes on everyone, on those earning at least $250,000, on those earning $1 million or on those earning $10 million.
Almost no one supported raising taxes on everyone, but wide majorities supported higher taxes on those earning at least $1 million.
Even most Republicans here support taxing those earning at least $10 million a year.
How do we square that result with CNNs? The difference probably lies in the specificity of the CNN question. In the Fox poll, a vague Should they pay more? even got a thumbs up for those earning at least $250,000, a relatively low number. Had that, too, been accompanied by the 70 percent figure, the results would likely have been different.
After all, people regularly misunderstand (or, sometimes, intentionally misrepresent) the proposal as mandating that the rich pay 70 percent of all of their income to the government; in reality, it would only apply starting at the 10 millionth dollar. That 70 percent seems intimidating, but we showed last month how it would affect the taxes paid by the very wealthy.
The gap between that black line and the diagonal green line is the income that the very rich would still get to keep.
An Economist-YouGov poll last month that asked specifically about Ocasio-Cortezs proposal and Warrens idea found that both have more support than not, although support for Warrens additional tax (at 2 or 3 percent) is more popular (and earns majority support) than Ocasio-Cortezs.
Its almost as though the hard part of any solution is establishing the specifics to that solution. [Editors: Is there a more concise aphorism we can use here?]
Even given numbers that have broad support from voters, its not clear that such legislation would ever pass Congress. After all, Americans have supported taxing richer Americans at a higher rate for literally decades, according to Gallup.
Finding legislation that could pass Congress and get a presidential signature has proved elusive even as income inequality has grown. It seems particularly unlikely that legislation raising taxes on the wealthy would be signed into law by a billionaire president whos committed to cutting taxes."

 (Photo: http://abcnews.go.com/)
It's official: a hedge fund helmed by Sears' controversial ex-CEO has closed the deal to buy the beleaguered company for $5.2 billion.
A federal bankruptcy judge approved the purchase by Eddie Lampert's ESL Investments last week, giving the green light for the bankrupt retailer, which also owns Kmart, to avoid liquidation and begin a second act.
The new company will be significantly smaller with 223 Sears and 202 Kmart stores. But it will be trying to thrive in the same competitive environment that hobbled it before, leading it to shutter more than 3,500 locations, and slash roughly 250,000 jobs amid tumbling sales.
Lampert said in a statement that the new Sears is up to the challenge.
The best possible outcome has now been realized for all stakeholders,'' Lampert said. ""ESL looks forward to a new era at Sears and Kmart that builds on their proud histories, while finding new ways to innovate and grow to adapt to the forces transforming the retail industry.''
The new business will be under ESL's affiliate, Transform Holdco, and ESL said that the same warranties and other programs for shoppers will continue.

On the roster: Omar smashed over sneers at Jewish money in politics - Fairfax defiant, demands ‘due process’ on rape claims - Harris: Legalize it - Budget talks resume on border security - *ahem* Fort night
OMAR SMASHED OVER SNEERS AT JEWISH MONEY IN POLITICS Fox News: In an unprecedented rebuke under the new Congress, House Democratic leaders on Monday roundly condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for statements about supporters of Israel that were widely viewed as anti-Semitic and called on her to apologize. The statement issued by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership team followed the latest in a string of controversial comments from the freshman lawmaker -- as well as pressure from Republican leaders to speak out. ‘Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,’ the statement said. ‘We are and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress because we understand that our support is based on shared values and strategic interests. Legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share. …’ Omar, in response, ‘unequivocally’ apologized, while reaffirming the ‘problematic role’ of lobbyists.”
Williamson: ‘The defining characteristic of our political discourse in 2019 is not that it is polarized, but that it is illiterate.’ - National Review
An unhappy association for American liberals - The Atlantic: “Her comments, and the backlash they provoked, show how fractured the American debate over Israel has become. Omar is the new face of anti-Israel criticism on the left, and yet her use of anti-Semitic tropes undermines her credibility. Her comments have provoked a cycle of outrage, amplifying the most extreme voices on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and limiting the chances for more nuanced debate over America’s support for Israeli policies. Instead of creating more space for critical debate about Israel, Omar has added credence to a common caricature of the anti-Israel left: that opposition to Israel is partly fueled by conspiratorial anti-Semitism.”
THE RULEBOOK: WELLLLLLL…“The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 68 
TIME OUT: LOOK, A SQUIRREL The Paris Review: “‘I read books to read myself,’ Sven Birkerts wrote in The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. Birkerts’s book, which turns twenty-five this year, is composed of fifteen essays on reading, the self, the convergence of the two, and the ways both are threatened by the encroachment of modern technology. … Writing in 1994, Birkerts worried that distractedness and surficiality would win out. The ‘duration state’ we enter through a turned page would be lost in a world of increasing speed and relentless connectivity, and with it our ability to make meaning out of narratives, both fictional and lived. … Birkerts coins his own terms: the deep, devotional practice of ‘vertical’ reading has been supplanted by ‘horizontal’ reading, skimming along the surface. … It’s a way to pass the time, not to live in it. Reading—real reading, the kind Birkerts makes his impassioned case for—draws on our vertical sensibility, however latent, and “where it does not assume depth, it creates it.”

Mills is the husband of state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who is considered a strong contender to replace Fairfax as lieutenant governor should Fairfax resign.

In fact, he may not even score $2 billion. The number is more likely to clock in at $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in spending for a border barrier – although Fox News has heard figures well below those numbers. ‘It’s not going to be good no matter what they reach and he won’t sign it,’ said one source close to the president.

FROM THE BLEACHERS“Chris, both my wife and I enjoy vanilla ice cream. But there are various brands, and although a matter of taste, some are decidedly better than others and some are downright terrible. Phony vanilla taste.

[Ed. note: I should hope so! As I understand it, the goals of the movement are to end large-scale illegal immigration, a more narrowly self-interested foreign policy and an end to the trade policies that grew up with postwar globalization. It’s a very ambitious agenda, and one on which the current administration has had some success. But we are a long way from achieving those goals. In all cases, achieving those goals would require cooperation and coalition building. You can win an election by being the least bad flavor on offer, but you can’t alter the trajectory of core components of our nation in the same way. That requires buy-in. Now, as for the more urgent question of brands of vanilla ice cream, I generally ascribe to the view that Häagen-Dazs vanilla bean is the best uniformly available offering.

WarnerMedia, which owns the series, wants it for its new rival streaming service.
 (Photo: JON RAGEL, NBC)
PASADENA, Calif.  Don't expect ""Friends"" to remain on Netflix for long.
WarnerMedia, which extended its license for reruns of NBC's hit comedy to the streaming giant, is planning a rival of its own. And the still-untitled service, to begin a rollout this fall, is not in a sharing mood.
""Expect that the crown jewels of Warner will ultimately end up on the service"" exclusively, Kevin Reilly, the TNT and TBS president who is also overseeing content for the new project, suggested in his first public comments about it at the Television Critics Association Monday. ""For the most part, sharing destination assets like that is not a good idea."" 
Netflix extended its deal for ""Friends"" in December, at a reported price of $100 million for 2019 alone, but WarnerMedia has an option to pull the show on Jan. 1, 2020, or share it. (""Friends"" continues to air in syndication on local stations and TBS). 
The new service will compete in an increasingly crowded arena that includes not only Netflix, Amazon and Hulu but planned entries from Comcast's NBC Universal, due in 2020,  and Disney+, a family-friendly destination for content tied to ""Star Wars,"" Marvel, Pixar and other franchises that arrives this fall.
Kevin Reilly, the TBS and TNT president who will oversee content for WarnerMedia's new streaming service, gave the first glimpse of plans for it at the Television Critics Association Feb. 11.

But Reilly says there's plenty of room for more. ""It's not a zero-sum game,"" he said. ""Our mission is to offer consumers an excellent alternative to be one of their choices. HBO, a premiere platform, gives us a great starting point.""
The company will begin promoting the service to the 50 million subscribers of HBO, who are expected to be offered a tiered combo package. Reilly declined to discuss how much the new service will cost or whether streaming services like HBO Now, DC Universe and CW's standalone app will continue to exist separately.
But unlike Disney+, which has sibling Hulu for adult fare, WarnerMedia will program to all age groups: from Cartoon Network's ""Scooby Doo"" and ""Steven Universe,"" CW's ""Supernatural"" and ""Supergirl,"" Adult Swim's ""Robot Chicken"" and ""Rick and Morty,"" New Line Cinema's ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" and Warner Bros. ""Casablanca"" and ""Caddyshack."" 
""There's no piece of content in the WarnerMedia portfolio that will not be not looked at,"" Reilly said. ""That doesnt mean every (show) will wind up on the service (or) end up there permanently.""
Beginning this spring, it will commission original programming aimed at each of these audiences, to begin rolling out in 2020. ""We want to offer a more differentiated, curated (subscription video) brand"" that doesn't overwhelm  viewers with programming.
""Were seeing consumers want more ease navigating and connecting to the environment,"" Reilly said. ""We dont think entertainment should induce a stress response.""

On Monday came word that Amazon and eero will be meshing together, with the news that the e-commerce giant was acquiring the San Francisco startup, pending customary regulatory approvals.
""We are incredibly impressed with the eero team and how quickly they invented a Wi-Fi solution that makes connected devices just work, Amazon senior vice president for devices and services Dave Limp, said in a release. We have a shared vision that the smart home experience can get even easier, and were committed to continue innovating on behalf of customers.
Don't suffer with a crappy WiFi connection.
 (Photo: eero)
In the same release, eero CEO and co-founder Nick Weaver said his companys mission, from the beginning, has been to make the technology in homes just work.
When it came to generally fast, reliable and secure Wi-Fi, eero, for the most part, delivered on that promise, though it came at a high cost to consumers.
When eero debuted, just short of three years ago, it was billed as the worlds first home Wi-Fi system. The $499 system consisted of what were essentially three identical white boxes or Internet routers, one of which you plugged into your existing router via ethernet, and the other two you strategically placed in other rooms of your house. These boxes effectively provided wireless access points and Wi-Fi extenders, and unlike most of the routers that preceded them, they had no unseemly antennas sticking out. That meant you could keep them out in the open where they'd work better.
They've gotten a favorable reception from consumers; Eero boxes have a 4.6 customer rating, yes, on Amazon.
Eero are still not cheap, though the first generation eero system is now down to $359 on Amazon. A newer system consisting of one eero box and two beacons or extenders fetches $399.
Two things to watch if the deal goes through: Will Amazon will keep the eero brand? And will it lower prices further? If anything we want our Wi-Fi moving forward to be even more robust, given the increased load myriad smart home devices are placing our Interest connections.
One thing eero helped do was usher in acceptance for these mesh-style products. Today various models along these lines include Google Wi-Fi, Netgear Orbi, and Linksys Velop.
In competing against Google and Apple, it's not the least bit surprising that Amazon would want to grab another piece for its own smart home ecosystem. That particular battle, of course, is really still in its relative infancy.
Terms of the Amazon-eero merger were not disclosed.

Two retail chains appear to have pulled two shoe designs by Katy Perry that some said resembled blackface.
Dillard's and Walmart appear to have removed links to the items slip-on loafers and block-heel sandals from their websites Monday.
They were part of the Katy Perry Collections label.
The loafers were sold in neutral and black, and the high-heeled sandals in gold and black. Both designs featured blue eyes, a gold triangular nose, and bright red lips. Some on social media took exception with the black versions.
Neither Dillard's nor Walmart responded to requests for comment from NBC News. Representatives for Perry also did not comment.
The shoes were available on the websites of both retail chains Monday morning, but links to them appeared to have been taken down by the afternoon.
According to the Katy Perry Collection's About Us page, the footwear is ""designed 100 percent by"" Perry.
The incident comes only days after Gucci stopped selling a black-knit women's sweater that was denounced by social media users as resembling blackface. The $890 sweater could be pulled up over the lower half of the wearers face and included an opening for the mouth with wide red lips.

San Francisco-based Eero was founded in 2014, emerging as one of several popular home mesh network solutions for consumers desperate for total wireless internet coverage in their homes, regardless of the space and layout.
The announcement makes sense when you consider that Amazon and Eero’s partnerships go back a few years. In 2016, Eero unveiled its ability to work with Amazon’s Alexa products, including Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, which was still a relatively new consumer product at the time. But as Eero noted, among its customers, one in five already had at least one Echo configured as part of a home network.
Eero co-founder and chief executive Nick Weaver said in a statement that the company was built around the seemingly simple but hard-to-solve problem that technology should work in people’s homes. “We started with WiFi because its the foundation of the modern home. Every customer deserves reliable and secure WiFi in every room,” he said. Joining (amzn) Amazon will allow Eero to expand its global reach and work with Amazon teams already devoted to smart home tech.
Amazon’s other recent power plays to dominate the smart home market include its acquisition of video doorbell startup Ring for more than $1 billion in 2018, and a similar acquisition in 2017, when it bought up security camera and video doorbell startup Blink."

By the time VC's invest, the company has already found some success. And when they see all the exits that commercial open source startups have made in the past year, they get excited. 
 ""We are excited about open source in general,"" Munichiello said. ""It tends to be cutting edge. As a result of it being open, some of the best developers have tested it. We get a sense of how they are able to create value."" 
 And sure, it can be hard to turn open source software into a business, but it's tough to turn any kind of software into a business, Munichiello adds. 
 ""In general, both investing and entrepreneurship are challenging,"" Munichiello said. ""There's more open source companies being created, and investors are willing to put their money at risk. When investors are writing their investment theses, they're thinking about the upside."" 
 A cloudy landscape 
 In the coming year, investors expect more change and innovation around the way commercial open source companies license and monetize their software. This is a question that some companies are still wrestling with. 
 Right now there isn't one standard business license for these types of companies to use. One startup Tidelift was even built around finding an alternative way for open source developers to make money off of contributing to and supporting open source projects that enterprises rely on.

""I think we'll see continuing spectrum as the polarized worlds of proprietary and open continue to erode to a spectrum,"" Anderson said. ""It will be interesting to see between all these new licenses, if one emerges as a standard."" 
 Levine says he's not too worried about cloud providers becoming a threat to commercial open source startups. For the enterprise software that startups sell, they usually offer additional features that a company like Amazon can't take. 
 ""You have to work a little harder and compete, but that's true of anything,"" Levine said. ""The key is you want to make sure your community is happy and [that they are] your customers."""

As New York City council members and other critics seek to derail the $3 billion of government incentives extended to one of the worlds most valuable companies to build a Queens headquarters, New Jerseys largest city says it remains an alternative. The renewedalbeit one-sidedcourtship began about six weeks ago, according to Aisha Glover, chief executive officer of the Newark Alliance, which spearheaded a failed drive to draw Amazon and its expected 50,000 jobs.
Our goal is to make sure we keep it in the region should the Long Island City location fall through, Glover said by telephone. We have reached out to express that our incentives on the state and city side have been passed, so theres more opportunity for them to be welcomed with ease.
Amazon, whose plan to build a second headquarters outside Seattle led hundreds of U.S. municipalities to dangle offers, ultimately chose Queens and another site, in Arlington, Va. Newark had been among the finalists, with an incentives package of more than $7 billion from the state and city.
If Amazon has interest in Newark, a city finally on the upswing 50 years after race riots decimated the downtown, it may be playing hard to get.
They havent been specific in their response, Glover said."

Mr. Baron declined to be interviewed but offered a statement.
Jeff has never gotten involved in our reporting or our final stories, he said. People surmise that it must be difficult to cover Jeff and Amazon. But weve gone five and a half years with his ownership, and he hasnt once intervened in any way.
The clash between Mr. Bezos and The Enquirer began last month when the tabloid published an exposé of his extramarital affair with the television personality Lauren Sanchez. Mr. Bezos fought back in his remarkably revealing blog post on Medium, the online open platform. He accused David J. Pecker, the chairman of The Enquirers parent company, American Media Inc., of threatening through intermediaries to publish graphic photographs of Mr. Bezos if he did not publicly announce that The Enquirers reporting on his affair was not politically motivated.
The Post has traditionally focused on the nations capital, with not as many resources devoted to business coverage. That has started to change. The Post had previously said it would nearly double the number of journalists devoted to covering Silicon Valley to 25, including a reporter in Seattle who will focus on Amazon.
It also aggressively followed up on the revelation about Mr. Bezos private life.
The Post published a lengthy article on Feb. 5 about The Enquirers coverage of Mr. Bezos affair. It quoted Gavin de Becker, his longtime security chief, as saying the leak of evidence of Mr. Bezos infidelity to The Enquirer was politically motivated, designed to embarrass Mr. Bezos because he owns The Post. Mr. de Becker added that the effort could also involve figures from President Trumps campaign.
Emails from American Media that Mr. Bezos included in his blog post referred to the Post article and demanded that he and the newspaper refrain from any statements or suggestions that politics played any part in its coverage of his affair with Ms. Sanchez.
Like other newspapers, including The New York Times, The Post ran front-page articles on Mr. Bezos and American Media on Friday and Saturday. Those were not the only articles about his interests. The paper also published a report about Amazons potentially pulling out of its agreement to build a headquarters in New York City, as well as one about a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the director Woody Allen, who said its streaming service had improperly backed out of a four-movie deal with him."

That was immediately followed by a critique from another Democrat, Senator Diane J. Savino, who represents Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, who said that many of her constituents, as well as residents of transit-starved sections of the Bronx and Queens, drove because they did not have the luxury of a one-seat ride via public transportation.
Not everyone who drives to work is rich, Ms. Savino said.
Mr. de Blasios testimony also took place amid simmering tension between Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic-led Senate over the issue of a plan to put a corporate campus for Amazon in Queens, using billions of dollars in state and city tax incentives. On Friday, Mr. Cuomo accused the Senate of governmental malpractice in its approach to the plan, particularly the proposed appointment of a prominent Amazon critic, State Senator Michael Gianaris, to a board with potential veto power.
Mr. de Blasio found himself repeatedly defending the deal in the face of questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Senator John Liu, another newly elected Democrat who wondered aloud why Amazon was being given tax breaks potentially worth $3 billion when tech companies like Google have said they would expand their work force without such incentives.
Mr. de Blasio countered, saying the Amazon deal was pro forma. The vast majority of the subsidy that Amazon got was standing incentive programs, he said. At another moment, Senator Jessica Ramos of Queens, a former aide to Mr. de Blasio, suggested that the most logical option for a progressive leader would have been to raise taxes on Amazon, rather than to give it tax breaks.
And so on. (Mr. de Blasio pointed out several times, seemingly to no avail, that state lawmakers, not he, had the power to make the changes they were requesting.)
Then, too, there was the small issue of Mr. Cuomo, Mr. de Blasios most prominent and powerful critic here. Mr. de Blasios remarks made it clear that there were conflicts in his wanting more funding for education and the citys decrepit public housing."

At the state level, however, there has been action. The private sector also got involved. Dicks Sporting Goods and Walmart both halted the sale of assault-style weapons in their stores, along with the sale of guns and ammunition to customers under age 21. Companies ranging from MetLife to Delta to Alamo Rent A Car did away with discounts for N.R.A. members.
The political world has sensed this shift in the wind. Of late, more lawmakers have seemed willing to boast about their poor ratings by the gun lobby. The 2018 elections were the first in which spending for gun-safety advertising exceeded that for guns-rights ads, and candidates backed by gun-safety groups enjoyed important victories.
Not all of the change can be directly attributable to Mr. Trump, of course. But, much as womens frustration over his presidency helped drive the #MeToo movement, his administration has energized gun-safety advocates, who have put the gun lobby and its cause on the defensive.
This wont yield an imminent revolution on regulating firearms, especially within the overly cautious halls of Congress. The N.R.A. remains a political powerhouse, an increasingly conservative Republican Party still controls the White House and the Senate, and guns remain a centerpiece of the culture war.
But with a topic this polarizing, small steps deserve to be applauded and encouraged. When lawmakers held a hearing on the background-check bill last week, it was the first hearing in eight years to broach the subject of gun violence.
With a little luck and some political spine, more such actions will follow. The victims and survivors of Parkland, and of the 339 other mass shootings in 2018 alone, deserve more than pious sentiment and political cowardice.

It could not be determined whether any of the material that Sanchez shared with friends was sexually explicit.

Gavin de Becker, the prominent security consultant who is overseeing the probe for Bezos, declined to comment.

Sanchez himself told Bezos and his sister when the story broke that he would have to be investigated because of his proximity to the couple. He specifically assured them that he is not the leaker.
Michael Sanchez, a Hollywood talent manager, has tried, with little success, to play a peacemaking role. Days before the Enquirer published the story about Bezos' affair, the tabloid sent Sanchez a letter — with 44 bullet points — requesting comment.
Michael Sanchez planned to fly to New York to find out what evidence the tabloid had and try to soften the story while pointing out factual errors. He made arrangements to sit down with Dylan Howard, a longtime friend who is the tabloid company's top news executive. Sanchez kept in communication with the couple and de Becker about his intermediary role and planned a conference call with them once he was briefed on the details of the pending Enquirer story.
But Bezos decided to preempt the story by tweeting about his planned divorce from his wife, McKenzie. At that point, AMI executives refused to meet with Sanchez and soon published the piece.
Still, Michael Sanchez kept trying to broker a cease-fire. He arranged a photo op with Lauren Sanchez as she went to a Santa Monica airport and got on a helicopter, with AMI's Us Weekly running the ""exclusive"" pictures under the headline ""All Smiles: First Photos Show Jeff Bezos' Girlfriend Lauren Sanchez Carefree After Scandal.""
But that limited cooperation imploded late last week when Bezos accused AMI of trying to blackmail him, posting a company email suggesting that his nude selfies could be published unless he stopped accusing the Enquirer of a politically motivated hit job.
The behind-the-scenes battle turns on fundamental questions about Bezos' strategy. Is he a journalistic hero, praised by Bob Woodward, taking a brave stand against terrible tabloid tactics? Or, as Michael Sanchez has argued, has Bezos inflamed the situation and turned one embarrassing episode into a nonstop national soap opera?
Michael Sanchez is a Trump supporter, and his connections to Trump World figures caught up in the Robert Mueller probe have also come under scrutiny in light of the well-known acrimony between the president and Bezos.
Sanchez has twice met Roger Stone, who has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, and Carter Page once through a minor business deal. But he has been in touch with both men about the leaks and whether they might have involved hacking, according to electronic correspondence.
In fact, Michael Sanchez proposed that de Becker, and possibly Bezos himself, sit down with Page in a secure location to discuss the security aspects of the leak.

While the polar vortex walloped a good chunk of Canada, we rode our bikes and strolled among the blooming flowers. 
Then, on Sunday, the snow hit. And our lush dreamscape suddenly turned into a snowy, slushy mess, straining our transit system and testing our collective patience.
Like the grass turning green when it rains, there are some things you can expect when it snows in Vancouver. Here's what some people had to say online. 
Transit woes
Snowpocalypse. Snowmaggedon. Just some of the terms used to describe the Monday morning commute, which, by some accounts, seemed like journeying through the nine circles of hell.
TransLink took a beating from riders. The transit authority tweeted that the snow had caused a ""slight reduction"" in SkyTrain service. But the photos shared told a different story.
&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/TransLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw""&gt;@TransLink&lt;/a&gt; one hour and Columbia, three packed trains, packed platform and shuttles just dumping more people. Absolutely unacceptable. &lt;a href=""https://t.co/cwxCtff3T0""&gt;pic.twitter.com/cwxCtff3T0&lt;/a&gt;

Vancouver is not, in fact, all of B.C.
Ask Canadians outside the province to describe B.C. and they might say balmy and coastal.
But B.C.'s South Coast is just a sliver of our vast province. CBC's Andrew Kurjata is based in Prince George, and as he reminded us Monday, snow and cold are the norm in Northern B.C.
Just a reminder that a large portion of British Columbia does get both snow and cold. This, and -20 C or lower is the norm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you direct your attention to a map, you'll discover Vancouver and Victoria only occupy a small corner of our province &lt;a href=""https://t.co/zXEleI7WpM""&gt;pic.twitter.com/zXEleI7WpM&lt;/a&gt;

&amp;mdash;@CKPGKendall
In snow reports one can see the actual geopolitical divide within BC: The controlling self-absorbed center and the rest of the province - kind of like the 905 belt in Ontario, or T.O. for the rest of Canada.
&amp;mdash;@charlesmenzies
The umbrella debate
And now, for a question that gets some people riled up.
All this snow in Vancouver means the return of a time-honoured debate: Is it OK to use your umbrella when the flakes fall? 
&amp;mdash;@cbcnewsbc
You'll find two camps here. First, those who argue that the snow on the South Coast is wet and an umbrella is an effective shield.

&amp;mdash;@padeeo
And then those who say it just looks weird.
Why not? It is just frozen rain. If it keeps you dry, Id say use it.
&amp;mdash;@dgct2
At the end of the day, do you?
yes if you want, but youll look lame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i only take issue with the rest of canada saying were ridiculous for doing it. you dont live here, our snow is not the same here: its wet af.
&amp;mdash;@mapledip94
Where art thou winter tires?
Last, but never least: bad drivers and ill-equipped cars.
One snowflake hits the ground in &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/CityofVancouver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw""&gt;@cityofvancouver&lt;/a&gt; and the entire city turns into an episode of ""Canada's Worst Driver"".

Should cars without winter tires be allowed to drive on the road? Is it even worth buying winter tires for just a few days of snow?
&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vancouver?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw""&gt;#Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; doesn't handle snow well. And neither should it. With only a few snowy days per year, it would be a waste of time and money to buy a massive fleet of plows and put on snow tires. If it snows, don't drive.

The B.C. Ministry of Transportation warns that, yes, you should have chains and proper winter tires on hand.
Regardless, cars are still careening on Vancouver's slippery roads. Twitter user Phil Doty caught an especially treacherous moment.

Rose scored 22 points and Teague added 19 for the Timberwolves, who played without the ill Andrew Wiggins. Rose and Teague both have missed significant time with injuries recently.
Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota, while Dario Saric had 19 points.
Lou Williams scored a season-high 45 points off the bench for the Clippers, making a season-best 16 free throws while going perfect from the line.
Montrezl Harrell added 18 points off the bench for Los Angeles, part of an 89-point effort from the reserves. The Clippers came in leading the league in bench scoring at 51.6 points per game.
Minnesota had lost its previous four games and six of its previous seven while struggling with injuries at the point guard position. On Monday night, the Timberwolves had both Rose and Teague on the court at the same time for the first time since Jan. 20 against the Phoenix Suns.
Teague returned to the lineup Friday in New Orleans. He had missed the previous eight games with soreness in his left foot. Rose played Monday after missing six of the previous seven games with soreness in his right ankle.
The Timberwolves had played nine games without having both Teague and Rose available.
Neither team led by more than eight points in the first half. The Timberwolves closed the half on a 10-2 run to take a 63-55 lead into the locker room. Rose scored 12 of his 22 points in the first half, including a difficult layup just before the halftime buzzer.
Minnesota then scored the first 10 points of the third quarter to open up a double-figure lead. The Timberwolves would go on to lead by as many as 23 points.
TIP-INS
Clippers: Williams scored a team-high 11 points in the first half and made only one field goal. His first nine points came from the free-throw line, where he was 9 for 9. Coach Doc Rivers remains close friends with former Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who was fired on Jan. 6. ""We talk a lot,"" Rivers said. ""I tried to get him today a lot to get the scouting report, but he wouldn't give it to me."" ... Los Angeles is currently on a 12-day, six-game roadtrip that will cover 6,659 miles. It's the fifth-longest road trip in the NBA this season. ... F Wilson Chandler (right quad strain) and F Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) were sidelined.
Timberwolves: Luol Deng started in Wiggins' place. It was Deng's first start since Oct. 19, 2017, the first game of last season, when he was a member of the Lakers. That was his only appearance of the season. ... The Timberwolves were still without F Robert Covington (bone bruise in right knee) and G Tyus Jones (sprained left ankle). ... G Isaiah Canaan was signed to a second 10-day contract Sunday.

aiming to launch the first of the four ships it is building early next year Within days a group of New York banks are expected to price a potential 3bn initial public offering of Virgin Trains a new passenger rail service in Florida By the end of February a Virgin Hotel will open in San Francisco and a Virgin Galactic space aircraft hopes to make its second test flight from Californias Mojave desert to the edge of space The Long Beachheadquartered Virgin Orbit plans to celebrate the launch of its first commercial satellite by the summerAs it prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Richard Branson founding Virgin as a mail order records business in 1970 the executive who now runs the company is laying out ambitious plans to push into a US market where the brand has been far less wellknown  and lucrative  than in the UKJosh Bayliss a Slaughter and Maytrained New Zealander who stepped up from general counsel to chief executive in 2011 says he has tried to bring focus to a private group that still spans 68 companies in 34 countriesHOTELS BloombergThe first Virgin Hotel opened in Chicago in 2016 with Bransonesque touches such as a louche shag room but the Miamibased management team have been tinkering with the model before rolling it out furtherIt took a long time to get to the end of the beginning Josh Bayliss concedes but the team has now settled on a concept pitching the offering as a home away from home  particularly for women Rooftop bars performance spaces to attract local musicians and restaurants designed to attract locals as well as tourists are all part of the new formulaThe Chicago hotel is now highly profitable Mr Bayliss says Further openings are planned for San Francisco Nashville and Dallas this year followed by a branch in New York and a rebranding of the Hard Rock Hotel amp Casino in Las VegasAt times in Virgins first 49 years it has seemed unclear what held its portfolio together other than the whims of its founder Mr Bayliss says Virgin is now more deliberate about where it applies its brand than in the days when Sir Richard was launching cola vodka cosmetics and bridal wear under the motto screw it lets do itTheres a misconception of Richard as someone who just slaps the brand on things he adds contrasting Virgin with another brandfocused multinational that was fronted for years by a stuntloving billionaire Its very different from the way the Trump Organization worksVirgin has also become more focused on finding financial partners with longerterm investment horizons such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds and on picking industries where it sees the potential to build multibilliondollar businesses by offering a better experience for underserved consumersThe US as the worlds largest consumer market has obvious appeal But it took an apparent retreat to fund its current advance in 2016 Alaska Air paid 26bn for Virgin America the domestic airline the UK group had launched in an earlier bid for bigger US revenuesSir Richard with just over 30 per cent of what was then a public company lamented that he was powerless to stop the sale and later implied that Alaska had castrated the carrier by dropping the Virgin name But the transaction provided Mr Bayliss with capital to explore other opportunities for the brand in the US and the pending 220m sale of a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic to Air FranceKLM will add further resourcesVirgin has invested 23bn since 2008 in the US Mr Bayliss says  most of it in Virgin America The recent rampup of investments means Virgin is losing money in the US but it expects a substantial payback over the next five years Virgin Voyages the cruise business backed by Bain Capital and GIC Singapores sovereign wealth fund has required 150m200m It has also put 75m100m into Virgin Hotels which so far has only one property opened in Chicago but plans to open nine in the next three years from Nashville to Las VegasListing documents for the Fortressbacked Virgin Trains in which Virgin will have no more than a 2 per cent stake suggest its investment there could be 50m60m And then there are the much delayed space launches into which Sir Richard said last year he had poured about 1bn of his own money and which Mr Bayliss says could still require significantly more capitalIt is difficult to confirm such sums from the published accounts of offshoots of Virgin Group Holdings the private parent company which is registered in the tax efficient British Virgin Islands where Sir Richard resides However they offer a picture of a group that is still heavily dependent on the UK 35 years after the first Virgin flight across the AtlanticIn the latest accounts for Virgin Enterprises Limited for example the subsidiary that oversees the highmargin licensing of the Virgin brand made 40m of its 73m turnover from the UK in 2017 and only 73m from North America  less than the sum it generated in Australia and New ZealandSuch accounts note the companies vulnerability to any decline in the perception of the Virgin brand and the groups efforts to crack the US have had to overcome the shock of a fatal crash of an earlier Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 CRUISESThe 278metre long Scarlet Lady destined to hold almost 2800 passengers floated out of Fincantieris Genoa shipyard last week ready to be fitted with interiors designed to attract a crowd that defies cruise stereotypesThe first of four ships Virgin and Bain Capital have ordered for their Virgin Voyages venture over the next four years it will test how keen urbane young experienceled millennials are to spend their time off at sea It is classic Virgin territory We definitely think we can shake things up Mr Bayliss says adding that Virgin Atlantic is already Europes biggest reseller of cruise holidaysVirgin Voyages is tapping a growing market the Cruise Lines International Association projects 6 per cent growth for the industry in 2019 which would take it to 30m travellers up from 178m a decade earlier But Virgin is chasing a relatively new demographicUnder18s will not be allowed Mr Bayliss notes and there wont be a buffetIt was a terrible terrible accident

aiming to launch the first of the four ships it is building early next year.

By the end of February a Virgin Hotel will open in San Francisco and a Virgin Galactic space aircraft hopes to make its second test flight from California’s Mojave desert to the edge of space. The Long Beach-headquartered Virgin Orbit plans to celebrate the launch of its first commercial satellite by the summer. 
As it prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Richard Branson founding Virgin as a mail order records business in 1970, the executive who now runs the company is laying out ambitious plans to push into a US market where the brand has been far less well-known — and lucrative — than in the UK. 
Josh Bayliss, a Slaughter and May-trained New Zealander who stepped up from general counsel to chief executive in 2011, says he has tried to bring focus to a private group that still spans 68 companies in 34 countries. 
HOTELS

The first Virgin Hotel opened in Chicago in 2016, with Branson-esque touches such as a louche “shag room”, but the Miami-based management team have been tinkering with the model before rolling it out further. 
“It took a long time to get to the end of the beginning,” Josh Bayliss concedes, but the team has now settled on a concept, pitching the offering as “a home away from home” — particularly for women. Rooftop bars, performance spaces to attract local musicians and restaurants designed to attract locals as well as tourists are all part of the new formula. 
The Chicago hotel is now “highly profitable”, Mr Bayliss says. Further openings are planned for San Francisco, Nashville and Dallas this year, followed by a branch in New York and a rebranding of the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.
At times in Virgin’s first 49 years, it has seemed unclear what held its portfolio together other than the whims of its founder. Mr Bayliss says Virgin is now “more deliberate” about where it applies its brand than in the days when Sir Richard was launching cola, vodka, cosmetics and bridal wear under the motto “screw it, let’s do it”. 
“There’s a misconception of Richard as someone who [just] slaps the brand on things,” he adds, contrasting Virgin with another brand-focused multinational that was fronted for years by a stunt-loving billionaire: “It’s very different from the way the Trump Organization works.”
Virgin has also become more focused on finding financial partners with longer-term investment horizons, such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, and on picking industries where it sees the potential to build multibillion-dollar businesses by offering a better experience for “underserved” consumers. 
The US, as the world’s largest consumer market, has obvious appeal. But it took an apparent retreat to fund its current advance: in 2016 Alaska Air paid $2.6bn for Virgin America, the domestic airline the UK group had launched in an earlier bid for bigger US revenues. 
Sir Richard, with just over 30 per cent of what was then a public company, lamented that he was powerless to stop the sale and later implied that Alaska had “castrated” the carrier by dropping the Virgin name. But the transaction provided Mr Bayliss with capital to explore other opportunities for the brand in the US, and the pending £220m sale of a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic to Air France-KLM will add further resources. 
Virgin has invested $2.3bn since 2008 in the US, Mr Bayliss says — most of it in Virgin America. The recent ramp-up of investments means Virgin is losing money in the US, but it expects a substantial payback over the next five years. Virgin Voyages, the cruise business backed by Bain Capital and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, has required $150m-$200m. It has also put $75m-$100m into Virgin Hotels, which so far has only one property opened in Chicago but plans to open nine in the next three years, from Nashville to Las Vegas.
Listing documents for the Fortress-backed Virgin Trains, in which Virgin will have no more than a 2 per cent stake, suggest its investment there could be $50m-$60m. And then there are the much delayed space launches, into which Sir Richard said last year he had poured about $1bn of his own money and which Mr Bayliss says could still require “significantly more capital”.
It is difficult to confirm such sums from the published accounts of offshoots of Virgin Group Holdings, the private parent company which is registered in the tax efficient British Virgin Islands where Sir Richard resides. However, they offer a picture of a group that is still heavily dependent on the UK, 35 years after the first Virgin flight across the Atlantic. 
In the latest accounts for Virgin Enterprises Limited, for example, the subsidiary that oversees the high-margin licensing of the Virgin brand made £40m of its £73m turnover from the UK in 2017 and only £7.3m from North America — less than the sum it generated in Australia and New Zealand. 
Such accounts note the companies’ vulnerability to any decline in the perception of the Virgin brand, and the group’s efforts to crack the US have had to overcome the shock of a fatal crash of an earlier Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014. 
CRUISES
The 278-metre long Scarlet Lady, destined to hold almost 2,800 passengers, floated out of Fincantieri’s Genoa shipyard last week, ready to be fitted with interiors designed to attract a crowd that defies cruise stereotypes. 
The first of four ships Virgin and Bain Capital have ordered for their Virgin Voyages venture over the next four years, it will test how keen “urbane, young, experience-led” millennials are to spend their time off at sea. “It is classic Virgin territory. We definitely think we can shake things up,” Mr Bayliss says, adding that Virgin Atlantic is already Europe’s biggest reseller of cruise holidays.
Virgin Voyages is tapping a growing market: the Cruise Lines International Association projects 6 per cent growth for the industry in 2019, which would take it to 30m travellers, up from 17.8m a decade earlier. But Virgin is chasing a relatively new demographic. Under-18s will not be allowed, Mr Bayliss notes, and “there won’t be a buffet”.
“It was a terrible, terrible accident from a human point of view” and cost the business “hundreds of millions of dollars” to rebuild the spacecraft, Mr Bayliss says, but he argues that it also made the team more resilient. Sir Richard owns 80 per cent of the US company, with Mubadala of Abu Dhabi owning the rest, so the entrepreneur bore most of the estimated $300m-$400m cost of the crash.
After many delays, Mr Bayliss will not predict when the first passengers will be able to gain a new perspective on our planet, but he notes that one person — an oil executive making weekly trips from London Heathrow to Lagos — has earned a free flight to space by racking up 1m air miles on Virgin Atlantic. 
Virgin and Delta Air Lines announced last year that they would combine the UK airline’s Flying Club loyalty programme with Virgin Red, which offers rewards to people spending money with companies in the group, from Virgin Media to Virgin Balloon Flights. “Now you’ve got not just a membership club but a currency,” says Mr Bayliss, who sees the new programme creating more “connectivity” between the group’s businesses. 
It could also extend the brand further if Mr Bayliss achieves another of his goals: to find a partner for a US version of Virgin Money, the financial services brand it operates in the UK with Clydesdale Bank, in Australia with Bank of Queensland and in South Africa with Absa Bank. 
“They’ve been great businesses for us to invest in. That’s the sort of thing we’d look to replicate in North America,” he says, skipping over an earlier, shortlived foray into US peer-to-peer lending using the Virgin Money brand.
Virgin is actively looking at financial services opportunities in North America, with a preference for building on an existing current account platform where it can improve the experience for customers wanting “something a little more exciting and interesting”, Mr Bayliss says. He hopes to seal a Virgin Money US deal this year, but the group has not yet found a likely partner. 
With Virgin’s longer-term aspirations for the US including radio stations and hyperloop transportation systems, it adds up to a dizzying wish list, but Mr Bayliss insists its US expansion can be coherent. 
“We have got huge amounts of skin in lots and lots of games, all of which, I think, link to one another in a sensible way,” he says.
TRAINS

Virgin and Stagecoach were stripped last year of the franchise for operating train services on the UK’s East Coast route between London and Scotland after breaching a financial covenant. Passenger railways in the US are also “not what they were”, Mr Bayliss observes, yet Virgin sees a growth opportunity in a country where the car has long reigned over public transport. 
In November it announced a strategic partnership with Brightline, the only private intercity passenger rail service in the US. Late month the renamed Virgin Trains USA announced plans for an initial public offering on Nasdaq which could value it at $3bn, despite losses of $87m on revenues of $5.2m in the first nine months of last year.

Women accustomed to gloomy headlines may have met this one with a fatalistic shrug. But it is worth interrogating why on earth it might be true.
The concerns are legitimate enough, but they fail to appreciate the big ways in which the world of work is going to change. In fact, it is quite possible the age of AI will belong to women. Men are the ones in danger of being left behind.
There are admittedly some reasons to worry about women. Some AI tools may be biased against them — a risk for any group that has been historically under-represented in the workplace. Because machine learning tends to learn from historical data, it can perpetuate patterns from the past into the future. Amazon reportedly discovered a few years ago that an experimental recruitment tool, based on 10 years’ worth of job application data, had taught itself to penalise CVs that contained the word “women’s”, such as “captain of the women’s hockey team”. 
On top of that, data from LinkedIn profiles suggests 78 per cent of the people working in AI are men. Not only are they shaping the future, they are also occupying some of the best new jobs to be created in recent years. A hiring war has sent the salaries of people with machine learning PhDs into the stratosphere.
It is right to pay attention to these problems and work on solutions. Algorithms shouldn’t be given power without transparency, accountability, and human checks and balances. Top AI jobs should be held by a more diverse set of smart people.
But it is also important to remember that only a small number of the jobs of the future will actually involve creating algorithms. Far more of us will find our work reshaped and revalued by them. And it is here that women may have the advantage.
As machines become better at many cognitive tasks, it is likely that the skills they are relatively bad at will become more valuable. This list includes creative problem-solving, empathy, negotiation and persuasion. 
As Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, has put it, “the high-skill, high-pay jobs of the future may involve skills better measured by EQs (a measure of emotional intelligence) than IQs”. There is no reason why men should not excel at these, but historically such skills have been more identified with — and encouraged in — women. 
Indeed, a new research paper from the University of Zurich argues the trend predicted by Mr Haldane has already begun. In the US since the 1980s, the probability of a college-educated man ending up in a highly skilled cognitive job has fallen, while the probability of a college-educated woman achieving the same feat has increased.
The author argues this is connected to increasing demand in these jobs for supplementary skills such as emotional intelligence, which has given women an edge. 
It is important not to get too carried away. The trend identified in the paper has only gone some way to closing the gender gap in top jobs. And there is no sign yet of a reappraisal of the value of emotional skills in jobs such as social care, which remain some of the worst paid in the economy.
But as the AI era dawns, it is the right moment to overhaul the way we value these skills, and the way we teach them. With an eye on the demands of the future, we are trying to persuade girls that coding is not just for boys. So why aren’t we also trying to persuade boys that empathy is not just for girls? 
We could start by changing the language we use. For too long we have talked about “soft skills”, with connotations of femininity and a lack of rigour. Let’s call them what they are: “robot-proof skills” that neither men nor women can afford to face the 21st century without.

Some critics of Amazon, however, found the situation ironic.
“I totally disapprove of what the National Enquirer did to Jeff Bezos, I do,” Tucker Carlson said regarding the alleged extortion and blackmail attempt. “But, it does raise the question: What is Amazon doing to the rest of us?”
“I wish we were a society that left consensual adult sex to the people engaged in them... That’s all the reasons why we should value privacy,” journalist Glenn Greenwald said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” before adding that “one of the companies that poses the greatest threat to [privacy] is Amazon.”
Greenwald, co-founding editor of The Intercept, said Amazon's online marketplace is just a small part of the huge company's operation -- and, in fact, its primary business has contributed heavily to making America a “surveillance state.”
TRUMP DID NOT LEAK MESSAGES BETWEEN BEZOS AND GIRLFRIEND, AMI LAWYER SAYS
“We think of Amazon through their branding, that it's some place we buy books from or download our Kindle from. In fact, their main business is working with the security state agencies to build huge apparatuses of the surveillance state that invade our privacy far more severe than what the National Enquirer did to Jeff Bezos, and that’s the part of this story that’s so ironic,” Greenwald told Carlson.
Greenwald wrote last week in The Intercept: “In December, 2017, Amazon boasted that it had perfected new face-recognition software for crowds, which it called Rekognition. It explained that the product is intended, in large part, for use by governments and police forces around the world.”
“Why do I never read that story?” Carlson asked Greenwald.
“It’s because Silicon Valley is more powerful than Washington, than Wall Street is,” Greenwald responded.  “It’s because Silicon Valley now controls huge parts of the media.”
Michael Punke, Amazon Web Services' vice president of global public policy, defended Rekognition in a blog post last week.

“In the two-plus years we’ve been offering Amazon Rekognition, we have not received a single report of misuse by law enforcement. Even with this strong track record to date, we understand why people want there to be oversight and guidelines put in place to make sure facial recognition technology cannot be used to discriminate,” Punke wrote.
He also said the company supported calls for legislation but added: “New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse.”"

The world’s largest retailer began bolstering its partnerships with third-party courier firms to reach consumers in 100 U.S. cities last year, after failing to use Uber and Lyft to deliver groceries, and struggling in its attempt to use its own employees to deliver goods. 
Deliv, which was one of Walmart’s earliest partners with pilot programs in Miami and San Jose, served the retailer with a 90-day termination notice, and the two companies stopped working with each other in late January, according to two people familiar with the situation. 
Walmart confirmed the previously unreported decision, and said it still partners with seven delivery firms, including DoorDash and Postmates, four of which it signed up in January. 
People familiar with the Walmart partnership with Deliv said the Deliv drivers had to frequently wait 40 minutes or more to collect grocery orders when they showed up at the store. One reason for that, they said, is because Walmart gives a priority to customers over delivery drivers during regular hours, which complicated the partnership. 
The store operations at Walmart “were a huge problem,” said one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter, adding the retailer could not “process online grocery orders fast enough.” 
Deliv declined to comment. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman told Reuters the retailer and Deliv mutually decided to end the partnership. “As with any pilot, the intent is to learn. And we ultimately came to the conclusion with Deliv that while their platform is a good delivery option, it was not the best fit for our program at this time.” 
Blakeman said same-day grocery delivery is currently available in 800 of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores and warehouse clubs, and the retailer plans to add 800 more this year. 
Deliv offers scheduled same-day deliveries through gig drivers, a model which can work well with faster order processing and a better ability to predict demand and robust volumes. Walmart is now working mostly with restaurant delivery firms that deliver an order as and when it is generated, one of the sources said. 
Both sources said order volumes were low in many markets, and one source said orders had to be delivered over large distances, resulting in both Deliv and Walmart losing money. 
“When the partnership with Deliv was struck, the hope was that demand will be stronger than it is now,” one of the sources said. 
Deliv operates in 1,400 U.S. cities, tapping into networks of local freelance drivers to deliver packages same-day for a fee for a range of retailers, from Home Depot Inc to Kohl’s Corp. 
In October, it raised $40 million in a new round of financing from investors, including Alphabet Inc’s Google and United Parcel Service. In December, it signed up 20 new U.S. retailers including Nike Inc and Nordstrom. 
Deliv can process and deliver thousands of orders in an hour. Walmart in San Jose was sometimes generating only a hundred orders a week, and there were problems processing that volume through stores, one of the sources said. Walmart is working to fix the problems at its stores to process orders faster, the source added. 
Blakeman said there were no problems with order volume in the market. 
The sources also told Reuters that Walmart has ended a separate grocery delivery test from 2017, in which it partnered with smart security company August Home and Deliv for keyless entries to shoppers homes, to deliver groceries directly to their refrigerator.

CNN ha intentado contactar a Perry en busca de comentarios. Perry debutó con su línea de zapatos en 2017. Están disponibles en su sitio web y a través de minoristas de todo el mundo, incluyendo Dillard’s y Walmart en los Estados Unidos.
Los modelos Ora Face Block Heel, sandalia, y Rue Face Slip-On Loafers, mocasines, vienen en negro y beige. Los detalles en ambos estilos incluyen ojos que sobresalen, nariz y labios rojos gruesos.
La imagen de los zapatos negros en ambos estilos ha sido comparada con el “blackface”, la práctica de pintura facial racista que comenzó como una forma en la que los actores blancos se burlaban de los esclavos africanos en espectáculos usando pintura negra y rasgos faciales exagerados.
“Otra para agregar a su archivo de blackface”, dijo una persona en Twitter.
Otros comentaron sarcásticamente que los zapatos iban bien con un suéter negro Gucci que también evoca el “blackface”.
La marca de lujo italiana se disculpó por su “suéter de lana”, que se coloca sobre la nariz e incluye un detalle en la boca con labios rojos de gran tamaño.
Prada se disculpó por unas figuras de mono con caras negras y grandes labios rojos y se comprometió a retirar algunos de los productos.
Para algunos, los recientes errores de la moda, junto con una controversia sobre el “blackface” que involucra al gobernador de Virginia, Ralph Northam, hicieron que la aparición de los zapatos de Perry fuera aún más molestoa.
Los zapatos estuvieron disponibles temporalmente en el sitio web del Dillard.
El lunes por la tarde, las imágenes y las descripciones de los zapatos se reemplazaron por el mensaje “Este artículo no está disponible para compras en internet”. Dillard’s no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios de CNN.
Un portavoz de Walmart dijo que estos estilos de zapatos de Perry nunca estuvieron disponibles en sus tiendas físicas.
La empresa no ha respondido a la pregunta de CNN sobre si se vendieron en su sitio web."

 That's how billionaire investor Ray Dalio describes his idol, Paul Volcker— the former Federal Reserve chair who's commonly viewed as one of the most important and influential figures in US economic history. 
 It was that zoomed-out perspective that helped Volcker rescue America from the skyrocketing inflation that afflicted it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His tight monetary policy was unpopular in the short term, but he was proven correct by 1983. Inflation came down, growth surged, and the US enjoyed a decade of economic prosperity. 
 And while that's arguably Volcker's crowning achievement, he stayed active for decades after leaving the Fed in 1987. 
 One prime example was his stint as chairman of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board under former president Barack Obama, a position he held for roughly two years from 2009 to 2011. As part of that role, he unveiled the so-called Volcker Rule, which was intended to scale back risky behavior by banks.

 Volcker recently sat down to chat with Dalio, who's become a legend himself by founding Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. The two titans of modern finance discussed everything from broad economic principles to the current US political situation. 
 Dalio was particularly interested to hear about Volcker's guiding principles — the ones that he's used to make important decisions and assess the environment around him. After all, Dalio led the discussion by saying he views Volcker as the ""most principled person"" he knows. 
 The conversation came several months after the release of Volcker's new book, ""Keeping At It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government,"" which hit shelves on Oct. 30, 2018. 
 Here's a summary of three principles Volcker laid out, which — in the spirit of his book — are specifically geared towards what makes a strong government. 
 (1) Effective governance 
 ""Alexander Hamilton put it all in a nutshell. He's an old Treasury guy, a financial guy. He restored the credit of the United States, so he's a hero of mine."" 
 ""He said the true test of good government is its ability to administer, not to create policy. Can they carry out the policies effectively and economically? Good government is not just high policy, it's making a machine work, day after day, efficiently."" 
 ""The faith of the American people in our government today is really distressing. We have a real challenge."" 
 (2) The economization of family spending 
 ""When you talk about principles, they go down in the family. And we were not a family that spent money easily. We liked to economize and be sure how we were spending money. I 'd like to think I carried this over when I had some responsibilities in government, to try to do it sufficiently. Not only as accurately, but as efficiently as possible."" 
 ""My father took over as city manager of this bankrupt town in 1930, and lasted for 20 years. He became the principle figure in town. He was a fanatic for disclosure. He would do a very detailed budget every year, and distribute it to everyone in town."" 
 ""He was a bug for not spending more than he had to spend, but spending what was necessary for a professional organization."" 
 (3) A strong class of civil servants 
 ""I'm with Alexander Hamilton. The true test of effective government is the ability to get something done efficiently. We lapse in that respect. You have to have a great feeling of commitment to whatever you're doing, whether it's as an economist, or a civil servant."" 
 ""Look at this present change in government. I think there are 700 or more potential presidential appointments in the new government. About one-third of those offices are filled. But nobody's paying attention. Who's running those departments?"" 
 ""Civil servants left there may be in good form, maybe not, but they're essentially leaderless. That's no way to run a government. That's just one example of the difficulties we're having these days."" 
 ""Countries like France and Germany had very disciplined, very prestigious civil service. So did the UK. That's disintegrated a lot in recent years because it's considered too elitist, too far removed from the public. It's a great trick — how can you get the expertise and leadership you need and still respect the popular desire?"""

Additional Reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING Li Zheng in SHANGHAI and the Shanghai Newsroom Editing by Shri Navaratnam,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The collapse in China of a complex web of debt guarantees involving several private firms highlights risks in its financial system and opens up a potentially hazardous front for an economy in the grip of its slowest growth in nearly three decades. 
It is the last thing Beijing needs as it tries to fight off intensifying pressure on growth from a months-long trade dispute with the United States. Yet, as the government steps up economic support measures and moves to loosen gummed-up funding, it might be inadvertently inflaming financial risks with its call on state banks to sharply boost lending to the private sector. 
The warning bells are already sounding in the once-prosperous eastern city of Dongying, a hub for oil refining and heavy industry in Shandong province. Here, at least 28 private companies are seeking to restructure their debts and avoid bankruptcy, mainly due to souring loans that they guaranteed for other firms, court rulings seen by Reuters show. 
Among the 28 firms are Shandong Dahai Group and Shandong Jinmao Textile Chemical Group, which were on the 2018 top 500 best-run private enterprises in China. 
For a private firm to get bank loans in China, especially those in traditional, capital-intensive industries, it often needs substantial collateral or the guarantee of another company. The guarantor itself is very likely to have taken on loans guaranteed by other firms. 
The private sector mess in Dongying highlights the inherent dangers in cross-guaranteeing of debt, with defaults quickly cascading across the system when one loan goes bad, threatening to disrupt local financial systems and new lending. 
The concern is that Dongying is just the tip of the iceberg as cross-guaranteeing of loans is a common practice across China. 
Private firms’ funding options are somewhat constrained because banks are reluctant to lend to the non-state sector, said Yang Zaiping, secretary-general of Beijing-based Asian Financial Cooperation Association, which comprises financial institutions from about 30 countries. 
“There is a severe imbalance between private companies’ contribution to the Chinese economy and the financing that they get. They account for 50 percent of taxes, 60 percent of GDP, 80 percent of urban jobs and 90 percent of new hires, but only receive 25 percent of loans disbursed,” Yang, a former Chinese banking regulatory official, told Reuters. 
“If private companies don’t have other sources of funds to repay their debts, or collateral, they have to find guarantees, which will add 2 to 3 percentage points to their financing costs,” he said. 
STING OF CHEAP CREDIT 
As of end-June, Shandong Dahai had outstanding guarantees on 2.67 billion yuan ($394 million) of debt for 14 companies, according to a company filing in August. The total amount of guarantees was equivalent to 48 percent of its net assets. 
Six of the firms have run into financial or legal trouble and two have been blacklisted by courts as “dishonest debtors” for their lack of creditworthiness. 
Resource-rich Dongying, the site of China’s second-largest oilfield Shengli, used to be one of the country’s richest cities thanks to its vibrant private economy, boasting the highest income per capita in Shandong in 2017. 
But excessive lending to local companies during boom times saw firms diversify into non-profitable, non-core businesses. So when credit conditions later tightened as Beijing embarked on a years-long deleveraging campaign, a series of loan and bond defaults in the region followed. 
“Bad loans are often extended during good times,” said a Shandong-based official, who declined to be named. 
The consequences are now clear. Two Dongying banks - Guangrao Rural Commercial Bank and Dongying Bank - have been hit by a sudden surge in non-performing loans. 
Over 95 percent of Guangrao Rural’s bad loans were backed by guarantees, but the back-stop is mostly useless now because it was provided by firms that were heavily indebted and some had suspended production, according to a ratings report in May. 
In Dongying, the local government has come to the rescue of the private companies by pushing through debt restructuring to avoid bankruptcy, said the Shandong-based official. 
The Dongying government’s finance bureau did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at Shandong Dahai and Shandong Jinmao declined to comment. 
TO LEND OR NOT TO LEND? 
China’s top banking regulator Guo Shuqing, one of the most powerful men in the financial sector, wants banks to double their funding allocation to private companies in three years - to 50 percent from 25 percent. 
But faced with the rising default risks of private borrowers in cyclical sectors, and given their unsafe financing practices - from share-pledged loans to cross guarantees - banks are wary of lending to them. 
Several bankers told Reuters they are keen to avoid repeating excessive and riskier lending that followed Beijing’s 4 trillion yuan stimulus package a decade ago. 
Even though China has cut banks’ reserve requirement ratios five times since January last year, banks would rather use this freed up liquidity to buy “bonds at any cost” than give out loans, said a bank executive at the financial markets department of a joint-stock bank. 
Private players are heavily concentrated in manufacturing and real estate whose bad loan ratios in these sectors have been much higher than the industry-average. Private companies were also the biggest defaulters last year, accounting for 126 of the total 165 bond defaults, according to Guotai Junan Securities. 
And, as the economy brakes in the face of domestic and external pressures, with growth slowing to a 28-year low in 2018, the fear is that the cross guarantee practice exposes China’s financial system to a bad loan crisis. 
“As growth slows and pressure increases on the economy, financial risks easily become contagious,” the Shandong official said.

Despite the increased pressure and public awareness, however, the union has yet to be involved in any meaningful discussions on how to better the situation, said Terry Chapman, CEO and business manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 727.
""We have not been seated at one meeting with anybody considered a stakeholder other than [Nova Scotia Health Minister Randy Delorey] who repeatedly tells us, 'I feel your pain. Don't worry, we're going to do something about it,'"" Chapman told CBC News.
Today marks 1 year of pressuring gov. &amp;amp; bringing attention to the important problem of ambulance availability with &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecritical?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw""&gt;#codecritical&lt;/a&gt;! We're grateful for the support, but less than happy ambulance avail. is still an issues across NS. NS's Paramedics and Nova Scotians deserve better! &lt;a href=""https://t.co/kC2UIasVlT""&gt;pic.twitter.com/kC2UIasVlT&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;mdash;@IUOEnsparamedic
For the past year, the union has been tweeting #codecritical to bring attention to the issue of ambulance availability, which Chapman said is a provincewide problem.
Between November 2018 and the end of January, Chapman said there were more than 900 instances of ambulances being partially staffed or out of service. 
The union has also complained of slow offload times that have paramedics waiting with patients at overburdened hospitals instead of going back on the road. It wants the province to figure out ways to fix administrative delays in offloading patients at the hospital.
""It's our people, our paramedics who are stressed and going long days with very little to eat, then being mandated into overtime,"" said Chapman.
EHS review coming
In an email to CBC News, the Department of Health and Wellness said it is working to improve ambulance offload times at emergency departments, which will help get ambulances back out on the road sooner.
""We've asked the Nova Scotia Health Authority and EHS [Emergency Health Services] to recommend ways to improve offload times and better manage patient flow within emergency departments,"" wrote Tracy Barron, a department spokesperson.
Those recommendations are due at the end of this month. A review of EHS and a report is expected to be completed this spring, said Barron. 
Barron also said the province meets with the unions regularly and ""is willing to meet and discuss their concerns around ambulance availability."" 
Paramedics are currently in active bargaining, she added.
System 'working as it is designed'
Emergency Medical Care Inc., the privately owned company that manages EHS in Nova Scotia, said anyone calling 911 in need of medical assistance will get an ambulance and/or paramedics, though it may take longer for a unit to respond if it's busy.
""The EHS system is working as it is designed   to expand and contract based on call demand. At no point are there no paramedics/ambulances to respond to an emergency call,"" spokesperson Remo Zaccagna told CBC News in an email.
He said paramedic units are ""moved around based on call demand""
""Paramedics, although they may start and end a shift in one specific community, are assigned to the province and move as such. If there is a gap in one area of the province, a paramedic unit is on its way to cover it off.""
Chapman said the current system isn't sustainable and he is calling on all sides to come together to talk about solutions. It's a public safety issue, he said.
""Something tragic is going to happen ... and it can't be fixed until all the mechanics are at the table,"" Chapman said."

This story was originally published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.
SIDNEY, Ohio Toward the end of last summer, managers at global giant Emerson Electric Co. called an employee meeting at its air conditioning and refrigeration factory in this county seat of 21,000 people west of Dayton. They had big news: Each employee would get a $1,000 ""special contribution"" to a 401(k) retirement account.
The reason for the generosity? The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act congressional Republicans had passed, and President Donald Trump had signed in late 2017, Emerson executives told the Sidney plant employees.
With the announcement, Emerson joined hundreds of companies as many as 750 by one count that issued similar statements to show they were sharing the wealth of a $150 billion cash windfall firms were estimated to receive in the first year from the then newly enacted tax law. On an employee bulletin board, Emerson explained in bold type that the contribution ""Affirms Emerson's Core Value to Support our People and to Help Them Prepare for Retirement!""
Emerson's and other companies' payments were a publicity bonanza for the Trump administration and the then-Republican-controlled Congress. Back in 2017, as the tax bill moved on the Hill, lawmakers claimed the cut they proposed in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent would trickle down to workers in the form of higher wages and bonuses. Emerson's action, and similar bonuses and wage increases, trumpeted by hundreds of companies like AT&amp;T Corp. and Walmart Corp., provided proof the Republicans had their economic theory right.
Or did they? For many of those same companies, a tiny fraction of the total number of U.S. businesses, executives haven't yet announced another round of bonuses or wage increases with the same fanfare even though the tax law continues to mean billions for their bottom lines. Several advocacy groups that tracked the announcements said no new proclamations have been issued. Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax group run by Grover Norquist which boasted last year of ongoing ""good news"" in bonuses and benefit increases, hasn't reported any announcement for three months. Americans for Tax Reform didn't respond to requests for comment.
At the Emerson Electric plant in Sydney, Ohio, mangers announced last year savings from the 2017 tax law allowed them to deposit a $1,000 bonus into each employee's 401(k) retirement account. The company doesn't plan to give another bonus this year.Kathryn Kranhold for the Center for Public Integrity
Most American businesses that announced bonuses and wage increases seem to be more like Emerson, which has ""no plans to make an additional 401(k) contribution this year,"" a company spokeswoman said.
That's what has made the promise of higher compensation so far elusive. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nominal wages increased 3.2 percent in January year over year, and by less than one percent three cents to $27.56 month over month. While some economists have voiced enthusiasm about the improvement, other economists note that wages must grow for a sustained period to offset decades of stagnation. ""The problem has not been solved,"" said Seth Harris, deputy secretary of the Labor Department in the Obama administration.
Bonuses have registered less of an impact, increasing just 2 cents an hour in the first nine months of 2018, according to Lawrence Mishel, former president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
The increase was ""imperceptible,"" Mishel wrote in December on EPI's blog. ""Whatever growth in bonuses has taken place is not necessarily attributable to the tax cuts, rather than employer efforts to recruit workers in a continued low unemployment environment.""
By all accounts, companies poured a hefty portion of the tax windfall into buying back shares, a move designed to at least temporarily boost stock prices, which benefits executives and other large stockholders. And buybacks, evidently unlike bonuses or wage increases, will certainly continue; Goldman Sachs estimates corporations spent a record $770 billion in 2018 on repurchasing stock with their increasing piles of after-tax profits and will increase that to $940 billion this year. Other chunks of the cuts went to dividends or reducing debt. Companies pay for ongoing stock buybacks primarily through after-tax profits that got a boost with the corporate tax cuts.
A promise of 'more money'
Back at Emerson, as managers unveiled the news at the Sidney plant, longtime employee Lerouise Rupert, 32, said she was excited at first. ""I'm thinking, 'This is going to be good.' They told us, 'We're going to give you a $1,000 bonus,'"" Rupert said recently while sitting with her three children in a nearby Wendy's restaurant.
Then Emerson managers explained the details. The bonus wasn't being awarded in cash because ""'it would get taxed a lot,"" recalled Rupert, whose job runs from driving a forklift and loading the assembly line to building electrical boxes. So instead, they said, ""We're going to put it in a 401(k) for you.'""
The contribution has had little tangible benefit for Rupert, who has a company pension but did not have a 401(k) account at the time, and for many of her co-workers. Their real need is for money immediately to pay bills, or in Rupert's case at the time, the chance to buy presents for her children instead of signing up for a local charity gift program.
""I was looking forward to this check for Christmas,"" she said.

Rupert's experience provides a stark contrast to how Trump and Republican lawmakers sold the tax law. ""You're going to start seeing a lot more money in your paycheck,"" Trump said a year ago at an event in Nashville, Tennessee. A couple months earlier, Trump, and then-House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., boasted the tax law would likely give typical households a $4,000 a year wage hike, with the White House reporting wages could even increase by more than $9,000 a year.
Manufacturing executives were particularly vocal, arguing that the lower corporate tax rate would not only increase wages, but also allow their companies to be more competitive globally and bring back jobs. David Farr, chief executive of Emerson Electric and former chairman of the powerful National Association of Manufacturers, helped lead the tax-cut effort and pushed for a lower 15 percent corporate tax rate.

Emerson, based in Ferguson, Missouri, employs approximately 87,500 people worldwide, with about 24,000 employees in North America.
Last May, five months into the new law, Farr told Congress, ""Tax reform is helping strengthen communities, build new career opportunities and increase paychecks for the men and women of America's manufacturing workforce.""
An Emerson spokeswoman said Farr was not available for an interview.
Emerson's tax rate fell to 17 percent in 2018, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and company executives estimate a rate of 24 to 25 percent this year, boosting profits. Farr told investors in an August presentation that the tax law allowed the company to increase wages and improve the company's health plan, parental leave and paid time off.
But Emerson reported it received $189 million in tax savings, of which it spent $24 million, less than 13 percent on its 401(k) bonus contributions a payment that brought financial benefits to the company as well. Emerson also spent $1 billion more than 40 times the amount it spent on the retirement bonuses in its fiscal 2018 buying back its own shares.
And for those on the ground, Emerson's largesse appears limited.
That's what employees say at Ridge Tools, an Emerson subsidiary in Elyria, outside Cleveland. The company has a commanding presence in the struggling town of 54,000, with its own water tower emblazoned with the word ""Ridgid,"" the brand name of the power tools the company makes.
Several Ridge Tool employees, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Center the corporate tax cuts have not increased their salaries. They have received the same annual increase in their wages as in past years: less than 3 percent. Emerson recently increased the vacation time to three weeks from two weeks for employees who have been employed for at least five years, they said. Hourly wages at Emerson's Sidney plant that make Copeland Scroll branded products increase by 3 percent a year under the union contract. An Emerson spokeswoman said the company is spending $3 million annually on improved benefits but declined to provide details. The spokeswoman said the company provides ""market-based pay increases.""
Ridge Tool workers also received that $1,000 retirement contribution, and not all were disappointed. Joe Neudenbach, a longtime employee, said he had planned to withdraw the money immediately at 61 years old he can without paying a penalty to buy a new recliner to watch the Super Bowl. ""The $1,000 was cool. I didn't see it coming,"" said Neudenbach.
Still, the one-time bonuses and one-time 401(k) contributions have been widely panned as public relations stunts that are not financially sustaining like annual wage increases. Longtime pensions and retirement expert J. Mark Iwry said, ""It would seem appropriate for employers to share their tax savings with their workers.""
Bonuses, then layoffs
Some claim the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was indeed a windfall for employees in 2018. The conservative Americans for Tax Reform group kept a running tally of corporate announcements through last October and listed as many as 750 examples of ""pay raises, charitable donations, special bonuses, 401(k) match hikes, business expansions, benefit increases, and utility rate reductions attributed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.""
But shareholders have fared far better than employees under the tax law. Companies spent $929 billion on stock buybacks compared to $7.1 billion on wage increases and bonuses, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, a left-leaning nonprofit group that tracked announcements by Fortune 1000 companies.
Another report by the nonprofit Just Capital, which tracks the Russell 1000 Index, which includes the largest U.S. public companies, found that 145 companies in the index announced plans for spending the cash windfall, and only 6 percent of spending was allocated to workers, ""more than half of which takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.""
Among the first companies to come out with announcements of bonuses and pay raises because of the tax law were Walmart and AT&amp;T. On Jan. 11, 2018, Walmart announced it was giving out $1,000 one-time bonuses to eligible employees and increasing starting hourly wage to $11 an hour. The same day, Walmart filed notices to lay off thousands of workers. A Walmart spokesman said the company has no current plans for a 2019 company-wide bonus. He said the hourly employees' average total compensation and benefits is more than $17.50 an hour.

On Dec. 20, 2017, two days before Trump signed the tax law, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson announced the tax law would allow the company to give one-time bonuses of $1,000 to each of its workers at a cost of $200 million about 1 percent of the estimated $20.4 billion tax windfall the company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. While handing out the bonuses, AT&amp;T was in the middle of laying off thousands of workers.
An AT&amp;T spokeswoman said the company would not be handing out another bonus this year.
By this time last year, a number of companies including The Walt Disney Co. and Southwest Airlines had announced they would use a portion of the tax windfall to give one-time employee bonuses. Southwest said it would use $55 million of its $1.3 billion tax windfall on bonuses. At the same time, it spent $2 billion on buybacks in 2018. Disney received a $1.7 billion benefit and paid out $125 million on employee bonuses and $3.6 billion on share repurchases. None of the companies have announced another round of bonuses. Southwest said it had no plans to give bonuses this year and Lowe's did not respond to requests for comment. Disney referred the Center to its January 2018 announcement.
Will it work later?
To have the tax cuts translate into increased wages, the theory goes, several factors need to align. Republicans and corporations argued the tax cuts would lead to increased investment in factories and machinery. That would create more productive and valuable workers, which ""would bid up the wages,"" said Mark Mazur, head of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But for that to happen, ""every linkage has to work,"" he said.
Meanwhile, in Sidney, Rupert is still trying to cash out her $1,000 retirement contribution, which was the only deposit in her 401(k) account because she didn't have one when Emerson gave out the bonuses last year.
Rupert said she is willing to pay the penalty for an early withdrawal but she hasn't gotten far with her inquiries.
A frustrated Rupert said the last time she checked her account the balance was just $867, a likely victim of the stock market fluctuation.

His expected visit, the exact date of which has yet to be confirmed, comes as Pakistan’s finance minister, Asad Umar, said his country had “come very close to having an agreement with the IMF” following talks on a multibillion support package between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the IMF’s Christine Lagarde in Dubai on Monday.
Any agreement with the IMF would help to allay fears that the $14bn those planning the trip expect Saudi Arabia to pump in to Pakistan will come with strings attached. Some observers say Saudi Arabia could push for a more extreme form of Islam in the country and upset the delicate balance of power in the region. “The network of Madrassas across Pakistan has flourished with money from the Middle East with the largest chunk coming from patrons in Saudi Arabia,” one western diplomat explained.
Saudi Arabia might have less sway than it would usually expect, however, because of US progress in talks with the Taliban about ending the war in Afghanistan. The negotiations, in which Pakistan’s role is vital, has given the country political clout that could make it less reliant on its conservative Sunni Muslim ally and give it more leverage with other potential sources of funding including China and the International Monetary Fund.
“This is a new chapter for Pakistan,” said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC, who recently returned from a visit to the country. “Any Afghani settlement needs Pakistan. Pakistan is playing ball with the US and that means Pakistan is in a position to make demands as well.”
In addition, the economy is under less pressure today thanks to the decline in oil prices, which has slowed the pace at which Pakistan was running out of foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan’s currency has also dropped by around 30 per cent against the US dollar since late 2017, making the country’s exports more competitive. 
“Today, Pakistan is in a much better place economically than six months ago,” said Taimur Baig, chief economist for DBS in Singapore. “It will be pragmatic and end up taking a little from everyone.”
“Today, everyone is talking to everyone,” added one Pakistani banker. “Pakistan is returning to the diplomatic fold.”
Still, not everyone shares this more optimistic view of Pakistani prospects. Earlier this month, for example, Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded Pakistan’s long-term sovereign rating to “B-”, citing diminished growth prospects. “While Pakistan has secured financial aid from bilateral partners to address its immediate external financing needs, we believe that fiscal and external imbalances will remain elevated,” the agency said.
Some analysts believe it is precisely financial aid from countries such as Saudi Arabia that has kept Islamabad from adopting reform measures that may prove painful in the short run but are necessary for longer-term stability.
“Mideast funds only offer temporary liquidity support. While these could eventually generate both exporting capacity or reduced imports, the short-run impact will not be positive for Pakistan’s external position,” noted Johanna Chua, head of regional economics for Citigroup in Hong Kong in a report entitled “Kicking the Can Down the Road to the IMF”. “Mideast support is allowing the government to take more time to negotiate an IMF programme.”
Saudi Arabia, however, remains a longtime ally of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army provides 15,000 soldiers to protect its royal family in exchange for $5bn annually, according to Mr Nasr. Moreover, there are about 1m Pakistanis working in the kingdom and hundreds of thousands more scattered throughout the UAE and Qatar — whose remittances have helped to narrow Pakistan’s current account deficit in recent years.
Pakistan has only about $8bn in foreign exchange reserves, enough to last it for about two months. The $14bn Saudi Arabia plans to commit includes $6bn in a loan to beef up liquid foreign reserves and in deferred payments for Saudi oil shipments to Pakistan. The remaining $8bn will go towards financing a multibillion-dollar refinery at Gwadar, a coastal city with a deep seaport near the Iranian border, according to senior government officials responsible for monitoring foreign investments in Pakistan.
“They [Saudis] need friends now more than at any other time and Pakistan needs investments,” said retired Major General Mahmud Durrani, a former national security adviser."

Better late than never. 
President Trump yesterday signed an executive order creating the American AI Initiative, to guide Artificial Intelligence development in the U.S. The initiative is intended to direct federal funding toward AI research, call for the creation of international standards, and encourage retraining workers. So far, however, it includes no new funding, no timelines, and few details.
Americans have profited tremendously from being the early developers and international leaders in AI, reads the White House press release. However, as the pace of AI innovation increases around the world, we cannot sit idly by and presume that our leadership is guaranteed.” 
True enough. The White House action reflects fears that China is gaining ground through a concerted national strategy, massive government funding, and much looser policies around data use. More than any other recent technology, this one promises to have profound effects on business, society and national security.

followers per sponsored post.
 USA TODAY
The Instagram influencer as a species is easy to spot.
Defined by their large social media followings, content from this class of marketers is typically awash with the flossy trappings of young money: trendy designer outfits modeled in exotic locations; marble countertops under carefully crafted flat-lays of pricey beauty products. Even the Instagram mavens with a grittier, every-girl style, all Polaroid grunginess, are dotted with on-brand T-shirts perfectly half-tucked into the hot jeans du jour.
Its enough to make even the most over-stimulated perusers pause and say, ""How much are they making off this, exactly?""
The answer, if they play the game correctly, is a lot.  
A wealth of jaw-dropping figures emerged in 2018, from makeup vlogging virtuoso Jeffree Starrs reported $18 million in yearly earnings, to fashion blogger Chiara Ferragnis wedding, elaborately chronicled with the hashtag #TheFerragnez, which garnered a whopping $36 million in Media Impact Value for her partner brands.
""You can't toss a rock in New York City without interrupting an Instagram shoot,"" said Brittany Hennessy, author of ""Influencer: Building Your Personal Brand in the Age of Social Media,"" and former director of Influencer Strategy and Talent Partnerships at Hearst Magazines Digital Media. 
That's particularly true this week as New York Fashion Week wraps up, seeing influencers rub elbows with fashion editors and buyers at designer shows and parties across the city. 
Theres lots of money at play. These girls make so much money. There are families of four who make $20,000 and girls can clear that in two campaigns. 
The most successful influencers can command more than six figures for brand campaigns, but even those just starting out can earn a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.

Why? Technology and consumerism have changed. Ad blockers are eating away at traditional digital marketing, such as banner ads and video pre-rolls. TV commercials arent reaching Millennials and Gen Zers who long ago cut the cable cord. Phones, influencers native habitats, are everything.
Brand spending on influencer marketing is expected to hit $101 billion by 2020, according to a study from the Association of National Advertisers and PQ Media. Thats up from $81 billion in 2016. Of brands surveyed, 75 percent said their company is currently using influencer marketing, and 43 percent of that group said they planned to increase their budgets in the next year.
The result is a gold rush in the form of street style pics and #mirrorselfies. 
Influencer math: How many likes to a $100K contract?
The economics behind the Valencia filters can be elusive. Influencers and brands are exceedingly tight-lipped about the ins-and-outs of individual contracts, leaving audiences without a firm grasp of just how much went into that strategically placed Fendi baguette. 
Most standardized price structures, USA TODAY found, start with follower counts. 
An industry rule of thumb, verified by USA TODAY through interviews with nearly a dozen influencers, marketing professionals and influencer platform founders, is a baseline rate of around 1 percent of follower counts per sponsored Instagram post, or $100 for every 10,000 followers. Meaning someone with 100,000 followers might start around $1,000 per sponsored post, while an influencer with one million followers could charge $10,000. And some experts called that conservative.

If you only do one a month youre making $100,000 a year. Thats a lot more than most of these girls were making at their full-time job, Hennessy said.
Lindsay Silberman, who has more than 140,000 followers on Instagram, left her full-time position as an editor at Town and Country magazine in October to focus on creating her own luxury lifestyle content. The tide turned around the 100,000-followers mark, she said, typically considered the made it moment for influencers.

After the first several months, she says shes on par to break six figures for the year and clear her previous salary.
Rates are also determined by factors beyond follower count, including engagement, quality of content, audience demographic and name/facial recognition and skillset, said Hennessy. 
In her book, Hennessy provides a sample breakdown that starts with $250 to $2,000 for a sponsored Instagram post for influencers with follower counts of 10,000 to 99,000, and goes up to $7,500-plus for follower counts of 1 million and up.
Captiv8, a platform that connects influencers to brands, has a similar baseline for clients that starts with $8,000 for a sponsored Instagram post for influencers with 500,000 followers or under, increasing to as much as $75,000 for 3 million to 7 million followers.
Some influencers do sponsored content quarterly. Their content is so good, and engagement is so high, they can charge $30,000 for an Instagram post,"" Hennessy said.
Engagement. That's where you come in. 
A dollar for your thoughts
Every time you decide to add yourself to an influencer's million existing followers, youve given that #blessed creator about $1 per campaign in future earnings. Add another if you frequently double-tap or tend to leave comments filled with fire emojis. A message about wanting to try that drink / lipstick / type of denim pictured? Thats the stuff of brands dreams.
As companies have become more savvy to the social media sphere and wary of bots and fake followers, engagement has emerged as a desired measure.
Along with pricing structures based on follower counts, CPEs (cost per engagement) have emerged as another way to calculate marketing rates. Engagement is typically defined by interactions with content such as likes, comments, clicks or shares. Engagement rates can be found by adding up all engagements on a post, dividing it by follower counts and multiplying by 100. 
Hennessy equates the audience element to buying an album from your favorite musician. If you love their content, ""you gotta like it, comment, share it, do all of the things because thats how advertisers will see that shes successful. ... That's how theyre making their money and thats how they can keep doing this work.""  
The shift in priorities from reach to engagement has opened the floodgates for content creators who may not have the same scale but have found a specific niche, dubbed micro-influencers. 
Influencers like Angela Davis, who started the food blog Kitchenista Diaries in 2012 and has 58,000 followers on Instagram, tend to have higher engagement and a more intimate connection with their audience. Davis 80,000 Twitter followers respond to her by the hundreds with the hashtag #kitchenistasundays, inspired by her Sunday night dinners.
Now its more than I can keep up with, Davis said. Dinner parties, public ticketed events, that all spun off from that one hashtag.

After unexpectedly losing her accounting job in 2014, Davis turned to food blogging and private catering full time. Nearly five years in, her self-published cookbooks account for more than 50 percent of her income. And shes seen more emails and diverse opportunities from marketing agencies in her inbox in the last year. In December, Royal Caribbean paid for her to go on a seven-day cruise to highlight their dining options. 
""My work with Royal Caribbean was specifically because of how engaged my audience is,"" Davis said. ""They really noticed, 'You actually talk to people and are having conversations on a daily basis.'""
Brand payouts
The advantages for brands seem obvious: direct access to target audiences for a fraction of what they'd pay in the traditional space.
Content creators routinely value their work at a much lower rate than marketing professionals expect to pay, according to marketing software company IZEA. In 2018, marketers surveyed said they estimated paying more than $3,000 for a sponsored video, while content creators expected to charge $471. 
Because influencers bake the creative costs of producing advertorial content into their fees, even the high end of influencer rates can seem like a deal.
You have to recognize that for a marketer to get that same photo from an ad agency, theyre going to pay 10 times that, said Ted Murphy, founder and CEO of IZEA. When someone from an ad agency takes a picture, theyre paying a food stylist, paying people for a recipe, shooting location, a photographer, a project manager and photographer rights. Thats why theres still a lot of room for growth here.
And ROIs can be as much as 11 times that of traditional digital marketing like banner ads, Nielsen Catalina and influencer marketing platform TapInfluence found by tracking in-store sales through loyalty cards.
Much of that is directly attributed to the look and feel of sponsored posts, and the way they seamlessly blend with an influencer's organic content. 
""A lot of these brands that are spending money with influencers are also spending money on paid media. And these brands are seeing much higher engagement rates, much higher ROIs on influencers, because content the influencer is creating is not looked at as an ad, it's very much look at as content,"" said Krishna Subramanian, co-founder of Capitv8. ""People recognize the individual within the content as much more authentic and thats whats really driving that ROI."" 
Platforms that connect influencers with brands (and vice versa) back up the effectiveness. IZEAs State of the Creator Economy report found that one in three consumers have purchased a product after seeing it used by an influencer. According to a 2017 study by Olapic, an influencer marketing platform, 31 percent of consumers said they have purchased a product or service based on a social influencer post.
But calculating exact returns can be tricky. Native platforms like Instagram provide only certain metrics, which don't get at conversion rates.

""What they dont show is how many people went into a store to make a purchase based on the influencers recommendation, or how many people bought the product or booked the hotel at a later time,"" Silberman said.
Silberman says she screenshots direct messages from followers who buy $300 face creams or five-day honeymoons based on her recommendations.
Dannia Hakki, founder + CEO of MoKi Media, a boutique PR firm, said it's now routine to include social media placements in press reports to clients, right next to outlets like The Washington Post and Conde Nast Traveler. But some things, like highly effective word-of-mouth referrals, are impossible to capture. 
""I recently overheard two people at a party talking about checking out a venue we represent, in which the client gave us an entire budget to pay a list of social media influencers. One of them said, 'Do you follow @narrativeofnic? She posted about that new bar. It looks so cool, we should check it out.' I couldnt believe my own ears.""
Influencers are supposed to disclose sponsored content. But ...
The idea that influencers are authentic, and that the products they promote are recommendations, not ads, is the lynchpin of influencer marketing. It may also be its undoing. 
Fyre Festival, the ill-fated greatest party that never happened, is often cited as the ultimate example of this dynamic. The 2017 event back in the news this year after the release of two documentaries, Netflixs Fyre and Hulu's ""Fyre Fraud,""  was promised to be a luxury experience before it's epic implosion from mismanagement and fraud.
Organizers paid a bevy of celebrity influencers to shoot extravagant promotional material and spread the word on social media, including a reported $250,000 Instagram post from model Kendall Jenner. Most did not follow Federal Trade Commission guidelines that require sponsored content to be clearly labeled as such, and have resulted in ongoing legal battles.
The FTC issued educational letters to 90 influencers in 2017 reminding them to follow the guidelines for disclosing endorsements. It sent 21 of those a follow-up warning letter citing specific posts that broke compliance. The impact on influencers who do not heed the FTC's warning could be dramatic, experts warn. 
Because influencers build their audiences and reputations on content perceived to be authentic, their followers expect that they are true supporters of the brands they pitch and will disclose when a monetary action is involved.
From the consumer perspective, its really challenging because the disclosures for most people arent very clear and ultimately that erodes the trust with the creator and erodes the trust with the brand,"" said Murphy. ""Thats the whole trick to this space. If all of a sudden theres no trust between consumers and people producing this content then overall effectiveness is going to plummet and there will be no opportunity.
Murphy says theyre still seeing 30 percent of marketers asking influencers not to disclose sponsored content. In their State of the Creator report, they also found two in three consumers might unfollow an influencer if they suspect them of not disclosing a paid relationship.
There are a lot of people skirting the rules right now that dont understand the long-term implications of what theyre doing, Murphy said.
Every influencer who spoke with USA TODAY stressed the importance of authenticity with their audiences, particularly when it comes to sponsorships.   
I make a point of being as transparent as possible with my followers about everything influencer-related because theres so much mystery surrounding this business,"" Silberman said. ""During a Q&amp;A on my story, someone asked me what influencers get paid for a post I thought about just telling everyone what my rates are for the sake of being honest, but I also didnt want to limit my ability to negotiate for future deals.
Silberman says some brands are solely looking for quick hits. She turned down a skincare company she was unfamiliar with that didn't want to wait for her to test their products before completing the deal.
To me, it just felt like a transactional, inauthentic exchange.
Many influencers interviewed said they'll only work with companies whose products they like and use without payment.
Jeanne Grey, who started her blog The Grey Layers in 2011 and now has 470,000 followers, said she saw success after learning to say no.
""I started seeing growth when I really found my aesthetic and mastered what kind of brands we wanted to align ourselves with, instead of saying yes to everything,"" Grey said. ""Initially it was like, 'Everything works for us!' But no, that's not necessarily true.""
The Holy Grail: Real money moves, then your own brand
Influencers say developing long-term relationships with brands not only builds audience trust, but it's also where they can make real money moves.
I would call it working smart instead of working harder. Better in quality instead of volume, Grey said.
Brands often restrict influencers they've partnered with from subsequent work with their competitors, but if that exclusivity is costing the influencer potential deals, she can use it to negotiate an increase in her contract.
If theyre being offered $10,000 to do a Revlon campaign, then that means they cant work with competitors Almay or Covergirl. So youre like, 'well, off of all of these brands I normally work with Im going to lose $50,000 in the next six months.' Now that brand has to pay you an extra $30,000, said Hennessy.
Influencers can also charge more depending upon the length of time brands want to use their content and how they use it. If that brand wants to turn a video from the influencer into an ad on TV or in stores, and run it for several weeks, that's an additional cost. 
If she was only charging $10,000 for campaign, then you add in usage and exclusivity, and she could easily walk away with $80,000.  
At the very top of the influencer pyramid sit traditional endorsement campaigns and ambassadorships, the likes that have long kept actors well-heeled as they pursue less lucrative passion projects. Those can include print ads, billboards, in-person appearances, TV commercials and the like. 
In 2017, Bare Minerals reportedly paid more than $500,000 for beauty YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen to be the face of two flagship foundations one of the largest known contracts between a blogger and brand at that time, according to Women's Wear Daily. Hennessy says she wouldn't be surprised if Nilsen could charge $1 million today.
Those types of deals represent the gold standard but are still few and far between.
We may do, like, four of those every year,"" said Lisa Filipelli, manager for vlogger Amanda Steele and a partner at Select Management. ""Theyre really hard to get.""
Steele started on YouTube when she was 11, signed with Filipelli at age 13 and now has 2.7 million YouTube followers. She's been the face of a Bulgari fragrance, worked with Marc Jacobs on watch and perfume campaigns, and starred in an American Eagle campaign. 
Id compare Amanda to, not top billed A-list movie star money, but its comparable to a working actor, Filipelli said.

And like many actors, Steele says those campaigns allow for her passion project: her own fashion line, Steele, which she launched just weeks ago.
Such trajectories represent the pinnacle for many influencers an ironically analogue end-game to their digital journeys.  
The holy grail for an influencer is picking a vertical niche, becoming someone who really understands the space and launching your own brand, said Subramanian. If youre an influencer and you want to win the Superbowl, it is launching your own brand and having it be successful and selling to a LOreal.
All of the influencers who spoke to USA TODAY expressed similar end-goals that have little to do with the digital spaces where they started. 
Angela Davis is working towards a brick-and-mortar location where she can host events and live cooking classes.
Grey is looking to write a book, create a lifestyle product and partner with a store like Target or Sephora.
A platform is just a platform,"" Grey said. ""I think doing this for other brands weve realized, 'hey, we can be a brand, too, and do this for us.'
Dont quit your day job, yet
Influencing may sound like a sweet gig, but many influencers say they work harder and longer hours than they did in their salaried jobs.
Im tracking my screen time and its about nine hours a day, on good days its about eight, Grey said.
Influencers told USA TODAY they spend entire days engaging with their audiences, responding to comments and direct messages and providing recommendations like their favorite products or travel tips.
""Easily Im spending half the week ... on social media,"" Davis said. 
Davis and the majority of influencers are one-man bands, juggling content creation with traditional office work like reviewing contracts, communicating with brands, managing invoices and tracking data.
Some, like Silberman, rely on their husbands and partners to help handle the workload and take photos. Greys husband quit his full time job last year to work with her.
And though brands are increasing their influencer budgets, IZEA found that there were still more content creators than opportunities in 2018.
A lot of content is uploaded to YouTube every day. Getting through the noise is really hard, Filipelli said. When I started out there were only two people with millions of subscribers, now its thousands. 
One billion hours of video are watched daily on YouTube, while Instagram users post more than 95 million pieces of content a day. There are no statistics on how many influencers are currently out there, Hennessy said, but she can no longer keep up.
""Every day I see a ton of new influencers, and Im someone who thats all I follow."" 
The gold rush shows no signs of stopping, said Fred Cook, director of University of Southern Californias Center for Public Relations. He notes that there's even a cottage industry springing up around influence, including startups like Wildlink that allow anyone to earn commission off their recommendations.
Some day we may all be influencers and this may be one giant marketplace. Well all be talking about products and services and being reimbursed for that in one way, shape or form, Cook said. I think its just the beginning.

For years, Andrew Gehrt, of Greenville, S.C., bounced among several low- and mid-wage jobs in food services, retail and sales until he was laid off from a position as a sales rep for a water filter company.
But after being unemployed for a year, the 29-year-old landed a job in September as business development manager for a technology company, at a salary of about $60,000.
I felt stuck, he says. Now, I have a very hopeful outlook for the next five to eight years.
In his State of the Union address last week, President Trump vowed the country can make its middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
Despite economists longstanding laments of a shrinking, hollowed-out middle class, Trumps pledge didnt seem so quixotic, at least judging by recent history. The vibrant economy, juiced further by the Trump-led tax cuts and federal spending increases, has lifted employment and wages for workers at all levels, including the middle class. The manufacturing, construction and oil industries traditional middle-class bastions -- have enjoyed revivals the past couple of years. And the replacement of many middle-wage workers with technology has slowed.
Yet analysts say Americas middle class will soon resume its long-term decline, largely as a result of automation and the continued offshoring of factory jobs, unless policymakers take dramatic steps to alter that course.
For the first time in decades, the middle class isn't shrinking.

The trend, left to its own devices, is going to get worse, says Richard Reeves, director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative at the Brookings Institution. A growing, prosperous, confident middle class is no longer going to happen automatically.

Minimum wage: From California to New York, states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers
Jeff Bezos news: American Media lawyer denies attempt at blackmail, extortion of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos
Economist Adam Kamins of Moodys Analytics agrees, adding. I think its a major concern for the U.S. economy.
Mid-wage jobs, defined as paying $14.18 to $23.59 an hour, are expected to grow by 4.45 percent from 2018 to 2023, compared with about 6.26 percent growth for both low- and high-wage jobs, according to a CareerBuilder study. Fifty-eight percent of jobs lost during that period will be mid-wage, the report says.
Middle class makes recent advances
The recent trend has been positive. Median U.S. household income which includes paychecks as well as Social Security, public assistance and investment income -- rose 1.8 percent to an all-time high of $61,372 in 2017, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures. That followed gains of 5.2 percent in 2015 and 3.2 percent in 2016. Yet after adjusting for inflation, that income roughly equaled the level in 2007, before the start of the Great Recession.
Its making up for lost ground but it doesnt really get people ahead, says Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
From 2010 to 2018, inflation-adjusted pay rose 1.5 percent for the middle quintile of workers based on earnings, compared with 6.5 percent for the bottom quintile and 2.9 percent for the top, according to figures from Brookings and the Labor Department. That data defines mid-wage slightly differently than CareerBuilder.
Top earners, who overwhelmingly have four-year college degrees, are benefiting from a job market that places a growing premium on higher skills, Reeves says. And low-paid workers have advanced as a result of state minimum wage increases and social safety net programs such as welfare and food stamps, say Reeves and Jay Shambaugh, director of Brookings Hamilton Project.
Middle-wage workers are, well, caught in the middle. Their struggles, Shambaugh says, have been compounded by well-known forces: the plunge in manufacturing employment as a result of both offshoring and automation; the sharp decline of unions that used to ensure higher wages for factory and other workers; stagnating teacher pay; and the meager growth of state and local government jobs amid budget cuts and depleted pension funds.
Heres the good news: The fortunes of the middle class have brightened recently amid a strong economy and labor market. Employers added an average 223,000 jobs a month last year, up from 179,000 in 2017. And unemployment sank to a near-50-year low of 3.7 percent before ticking up recently, leaving businesses struggling to find qualified workers.
Weve finally got to the point where firms are being forced to bid up for workers, so youre seeing a little bit more for the middle class, Shambaugh says. Average U.S. wages climbed 3.3 percent in 2018 after being stuck at 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent for several years.
Trump deserves some credit. His tax cuts and spending increases boosted economic growth by seven tenths of a percentage point last year to 3 percent, says economist Greg Daco of Oxford Economics. And Trump slashed hundreds of regulations on businesses, further bolstering corporate confidence along with investment and hiring, says Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner. While the initiatives also prompted longer-term concerns such as swelling the budget deficit and dismantling consumer protections theyve sparked the labor market in the short term.

Before he got his business development job, Gehrt says he noticed a surge in openings last year. He has resumed dining out and is finally able to sock some money away so he can eventually buy a house.
Industries that employ middle-class workers in particular are benefiting. Manufacturers have added about 450,000 jobs since Trump took office, the largest two-year total in decades, amid an improving global economy and a rejuvenated oil industry. The number of factory jobs reshored, or shifted to the U.S. from overseas, by both American and foreign companies, hit a record 170,000 in 2017 and notched a still-strong 131,000 last year, according to the Reshoring Initiative, which tracks the data. Harry Moser, who heads the group, largely credits Trumps pro-business policies.
The oil and natural gas drilling sector itself added 11,000 jobs in 2018 while boosting pay nearly 4 percent as a result of a surge in oil prices for most of the year. And construction has added 1.8 million jobs since the housing recovery began in late 2011, with average pay increasing 3.6 percent last year.
Yet Kamins notes the near-term prospects for such middle-class jobs are mixed. Trumps trade war with China is expected to curtail factory employment gains this year. And oil prices have fallen sharply from their early October peak, though theyve rebounded from late December lows. And while the housing market is forecast to slow this year as a result of higher home prices and borrowing costs, mortgage rates have moderated since the Federal Reserve recently signaled it may not raise its benchmark interest rate in 2019.
Outlook for middle class bleak -- unless
The longer-term outlook for the middle class is dimmer. Manufacturers are likely to continue offshoring jobs in large numbers, with reshoring simply limiting the decline, Kamins says.
And automation could wipe out up to 73 million jobs by 2030, according to a 2017 McKinsey report. High-level workers have analytical and managerial skills that machines cant replace. And low-wage workers cost less and are often not worth supplanting with technology, the study said. Others work in health care or other service industries that rely on human interaction.
Middle-wage jobs, in turn, are most vulnerable, the report says. Besides factory employees, that means workers who originate mortgages, do paralegal or accounting work, drive trucks and handle maintenance and repair. While some can be easily shifted to other tasks, as many as 54 million Americans will need to be retrained, the study says.
Reeves credits Trump for spending more on apprenticeships, but says government at all levels has fallen woefully short in rolling out programs to upskill workers, in many cases to work alongside robots or artificial intelligence. The federal tax cuts and spending increases are substantially widening the deficit over the next decade, making it even tougher to devote more money for retraining, Reeves says.
Other Trump administration policies also may squeeze the middle class. Trumps conservative appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and Supreme Court are likely to further hobble unions, Shambaugh says. And while the tax cuts help middle-class Americans, the vast majority of benefits will go to the top 1 percent of income earners, according to the Tax Policy Center.
New policies can change the dynamic, Shambaugh and Reeves say, such as expanding the earned income tax credit to more filers and reversing state funding cuts that have hurt public colleges. But such reforms need to happen soon, Reeves says.
A robust, resilient and happy middle class is one of the things that makes America America, he says. If the middle class loses confidence...it  becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

states have passed some form of gun regulation in the last year according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence And a growing number of companies are risking customer backlash to link their brands to the gunsafety movementGuncontrol advocates say nationwide student protests after Parkland  and the grim succession of mass shootings that have followed in the year since  all have spurred the further shift in gun politics And they say a strategy adopted years ago  to follow a trail blazed by samesex marriage advocates and take their fights to the states and corporate America  is paying offIn the coming year the gun debate could be thrust into the center of the looming 2020 presidential campaign like never before Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg one of the largest financial benefactors of the gunsafety movement is considering entering the Democratic presidential primary One early 2020 contender  New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand who once earned an Arating from the National Rifle Association as a moderate Democrat representing an upstate House district  already has spent part of her campaign rollout explaining her evolution on the gun issue to an

than they have in the pastIn House races last year groups and candidates promoting gun control spent an estimated 236 million on television campaign ads  more than three times the amount spent on ads opposing gun control according to a KantarCMAG analysis prepared for CNN Thats a stark reversal from the 2014 midterms when antigun control ads outnumbered guncontrol spots by nearly 5to1Last year the National Rifle Associations spending in federal races dropped sharply following a record 54 million in 2016 contests including 30 million to elect progun President Donald Trump according to the

calls to action against gunrights forces At a CNN town hall last month California Sen Kamala Harris who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination lamented the failure of Congress to act on expanded background checks after Sandy Hook She said lawmakers should have been forced to examine the autopsy photos of the babies killed at the schoolAt her presidential campaign announcement Sunday Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar declared she was not afraid to join the vast majority of Americans  to stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for universal background checksBloomberg recently told the

sayNo one has done more to lead on gun safety than Mike his spokesman Howard Wolfson said in a statement Guns would undoubtedly be central to a Bloomberg campaignThe NRA faces its own tests in the months aheadThe organization is under increased scrutiny from Capitol Hill after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty last December to attempting to infiltrate the association and other conservative groups before and after the 2016 election Last week two Democratic lawmakers Maryland Rep Jamie Raskin and Rhode Island Sen Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to the NRA demanding it provide more information about its activity to help TrumpAdvocacy organizations including a guncontrol legal group founded by former Arizona congresswoman and shooting victim Gabby Giffords have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission alleging the NRA illegally coordinated its political advertising with Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and other Republican candidates Those complaints followed media reports that raised questions about the NRAs relationship with what appeared to be shell companies purchasing adsCampaignfinance laws bar outside groups from coordinating their spending activities with federal candidatesThe NRA complies with all election laws and any suggestion to the contrary is false NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in an email to CNNAnd the NRA has argued in an ongoing lawsuit against New York state officials that it could be forced to curtail its operations if New York regulators persist with a crackdown that threatens its insurance and banking relationships To be sure gunrights groups have had gains in the last year particularly in red states NRA officials say 84 of the candidates it endorsed at the state level in 2018 won their electionsA recent law in Wyoming allows individuals to carry concealed weapons into places of worship And last month South Dakotas newly elected Republican Gov Kristi Noem signed her first bill into law an NRAbacked measure that allows residents and visitors to carry a concealed handgun without first acquiring a permit At the federal level an ardent gunrights advocate Republican Marsha Blackburn won an open US Senate seat in Tennessee last November Two other Republicans favored by the NRA Josh Hawley in Missouri and Mike Braun in Indiana toppled Democratic incumbents helping expand the GOPs majority in the SenateThose Senate victories have strengthened the NRAs firewall against any efforts in Congress to restrict access to guns Baker saidWith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her antigun minions in control of the House we will see an uptick in PR stunts as the House passes every extreme guncontrol measure under the sun Baker saidBut the fact remains They do not have 60 votes in the Senate or an antigun President in the White House so their theatrics will be geared towards fundraising and establishing the most liberal records for the 2020 primary election instead of doing their jobsNRA officials say the focus on the Senate  where Republicans have retained their power to confirm Trumps judicial picks  already has paid off with the Supreme Courts recent decision to take up a gunrights case for the first time since 2010 That case centers on whether a New York City gun law restricting where licensed handgun owners can travel with their firearms violates the Second Amendment By tackling the issue the high courts newly reinforced conservative majority may finally reenergize a Second Amendment that has been neglected for too long the NRA said in a statement The court will hear those arguments in the next term which starts in OctoberAnd despite recent gains by guncontrol advocates few political observers doubt the NRAs ability to rapidly fill its coffers as the 2020 presidential contest heats up In a video last week NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch singled out the candidacy of Harris a former California attorney general as representing an existential threat to the Second Amendment Loesch then urged viewers to donate to the NRA which she called the one organization powerful enough to disrupt the socialist plan to disarm AmericaFor many people who joined the

standing for somethingWhen things like this happen and we dont act he said then theres also a large group of our customers who will lose faith in usCNNs Grace Sparks and Alison Main contributed to this story,"Washington (CNN)Nearly a year after a gunman massacred 17 students and staffers at a Parkland, Florida, high school, the political landscape on guns has shifted.
Dozens of lawmakers endorsed by the gun-safety group Everytown for Gun Safety now hold seats in the US House -- many part of a freshman wave that helped Democrats seize control of the chamber in November's midterm elections. More than 20 states have passed some form of gun regulation in the last year, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. And a growing number of companies are risking customer backlash to link their brands to the gun-safety movement.
Gun-control advocates say nationwide student protests after Parkland -- and the grim succession of mass shootings that have followed in the year since -- all have spurred the further shift in gun politics. And they say a strategy adopted years ago -- to follow a trail blazed by same-sex marriage advocates and take their fights to the states and corporate America -- is paying off.
In the coming year, the gun debate could be thrust into the center of the looming 2020 presidential campaign like never before. 
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the largest financial benefactors of the gun-safety movement, is considering entering the Democratic presidential primary. One early 2020 contender -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who once earned an A-rating from the National Rifle Association as a moderate Democrat representing an upstate House district -- already has spent part of her campaign rollout explaining her evolution on the gun issue to an increasingly progressive Democratic electorate. 
""We're heading toward a new era on guns,"" said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist think tank Third Way and a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. ""I think the tables have turned on the NRA. The gun-safety organizations are just better and smarter than they used to be. They have a lot more resources than they have in the past.""
In House races last year, groups and candidates promoting gun control spent an estimated $23.6 million on television campaign ads -- more than three times the amount spent on ads opposing gun control, according to a Kantar-CMAG analysis prepared for CNN. That's a stark reversal from the 2014 midterms when anti-gun control ads outnumbered gun-control spots by nearly 5-to-1.
Last year, the National Rifle Association's spending in federal races dropped sharply, following a record $54 million in 2016 contests, including $30 million to elect pro-gun President Donald Trump, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
""Gun safety is no longer the third rail of American politics,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, a Bloomberg-aligned group that plowed $30 million into the 2018 midterm elections for Congress. ""We've buried that myth.""
In one of the latest examples of the growing corporate activism on guns, Blake Mycoskie, the founder of the California-based Toms shoe company, heads to Capitol Hill this week to deliver more than 700,000 postcards. They urge lawmakers to pass one of the first bills introduced by the new Democratic majority in the House: a measure that would impose background checks on virtually all gun sales.
Bloomberg, who Forbes estimates is worth nearly $50 billion, launched Everytown partly in response to a 2012 mass shooting at a Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 young children and six adults died. Despite weeks of intense debate on Capitol Hill, congressional efforts on guns stalled.
Feinblatt said Everytown took a cue from the architects of the marriage-equality movement, which chipped away at state restrictions on same-sex marriage until scoring a historic victory in 2015 when the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide.
""The gun-safety movement did the same thing and is racking up win after win across the country in red, blue and purple states,"" he said. 
Gun-control activists have helped pass background-check ballot initiatives in Washington and Nevada, along with a slew of new laws to disarm domestic abusers and allow family members and law enforcement officials to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others.
In Florida, then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed bills last year, in the wake of Parkland, raising the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 from 18 and imposing a three-day waiting period on buying firearms. In neighboring Georgia, Democrat Lucy McBath, a gun-control activist who lost her son to gun violence in 2012, captured a Republican House seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich following $4 million in spending on her behalf by Everytown.
The group also saw 2018 wins in Nevada and Michigan, where Everytown spent $760,000 backing the campaign of Michigan's new Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It said it spent $2.8 million supporting Steve Sisolak in Nevada, the first Democrat elected governor there since 1994. Sisolak defeated Republican Adam Laxalt, who as Nevada attorney general had opposed a 2016 Bloomberg-backed ballot initiative expanding background checks in the state. 
Both states are crucial to Democrats' presidential ambitions: Michigan narrowly backed Trump in 2016 after going for President Barack Obama four years earlier. And Nevada, a perennial presidential swing state, hosts the West's first Democratic nominating contest in 2020. 
Everytown's activism means ""no candidate for president can go into those states and not talk pretty muscularly about the issue of gun safety,"" Feinblatt said.
Several already have delivered impassioned calls to action against gun-rights forces. 
At a CNN town hall last month, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, lamented the failure of Congress to act on expanded background checks after Sandy Hook. She said lawmakers should have been forced to examine the autopsy photos of the ""babies"" killed at the school.
At her presidential campaign announcement Sunday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, declared she was ""not afraid to join the vast majority of Americans ... to stand up to the gun lobby"" and advocate for universal background checks.
Bloomberg recently told the Associated Press that he will decide on a presidential bid by month's end. Through his activism on gun-safety issues, Bloomberg has built a substantial political operation. 
Everytown officials say it and its affiliates have 5.7 million supporters. In the last six months alone, the former mayor has attended 17 events in 15 states with volunteers from Moms Demand Action, Everytown's grassroots arm, his aides say.
""No one has done more to lead on gun safety than Mike,"" his spokesman Howard Wolfson said in a statement. ""Guns would undoubtedly be central to a Bloomberg campaign.""
The NRA faces its own tests in the months ahead.
The organization is under increased scrutiny from Capitol Hill after alleged Russian spy Maria Butina pleaded guilty last December to attempting to infiltrate the association and other conservative groups before and after the 2016 election. Last week, two Democratic lawmakers, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to the NRA, demanding it provide more information about its activity to help Trump.
Advocacy organizations, including a gun-control legal group founded by former Arizona congresswoman and shooting victim Gabby Giffords, have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission, alleging the NRA illegally coordinated its political advertising with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and other Republican candidates. Those complaints followed media reports that raised questions about the NRA's relationship with what appeared to be shell companies purchasing ads.
Campaign-finance laws bar outside groups from coordinating their spending activities with federal candidates.
""The NRA complies with all election laws and any suggestion to the contrary is false,"" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in an email to CNN.
And the NRA has argued in an ongoing lawsuit against New York state officials that it could be forced to curtail its operations if New York regulators persist with a crackdown that threatens its insurance and banking relationships. 
To be sure, gun-rights groups have had gains in the last year, particularly in red states. NRA officials say 84% of the candidates it endorsed at the state level in 2018 won their elections.
A recent law in Wyoming allows individuals to carry concealed weapons into places of worship. And last month, South Dakota's newly elected Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed her first bill into law: an NRA-backed measure that allows residents and visitors to carry a concealed handgun without first acquiring a permit. 
At the federal level, an ardent gun-rights advocate, Republican Marsha Blackburn, won an open US Senate seat in Tennessee last November. Two other Republicans favored by the NRA, Josh Hawley in Missouri and Mike Braun in Indiana toppled Democratic incumbents, helping expand the GOP's majority in the Senate.
Those Senate victories have strengthened the NRA's firewall against any efforts in Congress to restrict access to guns, Baker said.
""With (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and her anti-gun minions in control of the House, we will see an uptick in PR stunts as the House passes every extreme gun-control measure under the sun,"" Baker said.
""But the fact remains: They do not have 60 votes in the Senate or an anti-gun President in the White House, so their theatrics will be geared towards fundraising and establishing the most liberal records for the 2020 primary election instead of doing their jobs.""
NRA officials say the focus on the Senate -- where Republicans have retained their power to confirm Trump's judicial picks -- already has paid off with the Supreme Court's recent decision to take up a gun-rights case for the first time since 2010. 
That case centers on whether a New York City gun law, restricting where licensed handgun owners can travel with their firearms, violates the Second Amendment. By tackling the issue, the high court's newly reinforced conservative majority ""may finally re-energize a Second Amendment that has been neglected for too long,"" the NRA said in a statement. 
The court will hear those arguments in the next term, which starts in October.
And despite recent gains by gun-control advocates, few political observers doubt the NRA's ability to rapidly fill its coffers as the 2020 presidential contest heats up. In a video last week, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch singled out the candidacy of Harris, a former California attorney general, as representing an ""existential threat"" to the Second Amendment. 
Loesch then urged viewers to donate to the NRA, which she called ""the one organization powerful enough to disrupt the socialist plan to disarm America.""
For many people who joined the gun-control movement in the past year, Parkland was a defining moment. Survivors led hundreds of thousands of protestors in March for Our Lives rallies around the country a little more than a month after the shooting.
And some businesses began to reexamine their policies. Dick's Sporting Goods, for instance, removed assault-style rifles from its Field &amp; Stream stores and stopped selling guns to anyone younger than 21. Walmart raised the age to purchase firearms to 21 from 18. Last September, the iconic denim brand Levi Strauss pledged $1 million to groups working to curb gun violence and partnered with Bloomberg to build a coalition of business executives committed to working on gun control.
As a father, Mycoskie, the founder of Toms, said he had been shaken by the carnage in Parkland. Last November, however, the violence struck closer: 12 people were shot dead at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, just 15 minutes from his home.
The following morning his wife, Heather, called him as he headed into Toms headquarters and said, ""'I'm scared, and I don't want to take our (four-year-old) son to school today,' ""Mycoskie recalled in a recent interview.
""She was very emotional and basically said that somebody has to do something about this.""
Within weeks, Toms had committed $5 million to groups working on gun violence, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, a grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. He launched a postcard-writing campaign on the Toms website and in its stores, urging Congress to pass universal background checks.
Mycoskie, 42, is no stranger to corporate activism. He started the shoe brand in 2006 with a mission of philanthropy and has donated shoes to more than 86 million people so far. The Toms eyeglass brand helps finance eyesight restoration; proceeds from its coffee-roasting operation help supply clean water in poor communities.
Jumping into the gun debate was a new risk, however. For starters, the company's internal polling shows its customer base divides equally between Republicans and Democrats, Mycoskie said. 
And corporations taking gun-safety stands have faced a backlash from gun owners and conservatives. Just last year, Georgia's Republican-controlled legislature blocked a tax break on jet fuel after Delta ended a discount-fare program with the NRA. (A few months later, then-Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, took executive action and halted collection of the tax.)
""What these corporations and billionaire politicians fail to realize is that the Second Amendment is in the hearts and minds of the American people,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, another NRA spokesman.
But for some companies, the benefits of reaching a new segment of shoppers could outweigh the downsides.
Millennials, defined by the Pew Research Center as those born between 1981 and 1996, are poised to overtake Baby Boomers as the nation's largest living generation this year. CNN's 2018 exit polling shows the highest level of support for gun control measures -- 66% -- among younger voters between the ages of 18 to 29.
These generational differences underscore the ""upside potential"" on the gun issue for brands that appeal to a younger customer base, said Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University's School of Business. 
""Corporations have a finger in the wind and they are looking down the road -- what's the likely direction in the future?"" added Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York-Cortland, who has written five books on gun policy.
""Many have come to the conclusion that this a good step for them, precisely because it burnishes their social responsibility model,"" he said.
Mycoskie said Toms draws on mothers on the ""older edge"" of the millennial generation for the biggest share of its customers, and, so far, the reaction to its gun activism seems mostly positive. The company's review of social media found that about 75% of customers back the move, and about 12% oppose it strongly and say they will boycott Toms brands.
""In theory, we lost about 12% of our customers, which is a big number in a business our size,"" he said.
But Mycoskie said direct, e-commerce sales are up about 21% -- as people visit the website site to join the postcard campaign and start shopping while there. It's too soon, he said, to gauge the effect on wholesale orders, many of which were placed months before his background-check campaign began.

EU countries with smaller populations have for years blocked efforts to narrow loopholes that allow tax evasion and in some cases even money laundering in the bloc. 
Many of them defend their right to decide their own tax laws and attract foreign business by offering sweeteners. 
In an attempt to break the deadlock, the EU executive commission proposed last month to gradually remove the veto power that states wield on the overhaul of tax rules. 
But at the meeting in Brussels, Luxembourg, Malta, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden called for maintaining their veto power. The opposition of only one of them would be sufficient to block the planned overhaul in the whole 28-nation bloc. 
The Commission had proposed to gradually move to majority voting on some minor tax issues, but crucially permitted states to decide on this structural reform by unanimity. 
The Commission, led by Luxembourg’s former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, declined to use a neglected rule that would allow tax reforms to be adopted by a majority, a move that could have effectively ended the veto power when competition is distorted. 
Luxembourg’s Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna was among the most vocal of those against the reform proposed by the Commission. He told reporters that to preserve the unanimity on tax decisions was “extremely important”. 
The tiny state wedged between Germany and France for years blocked EU anti-tax evasion rules that require the exchange of information on bank accounts held by foreign citizens. 
It is also one of the staunchest opponents to the introduction of a common tax base in the EU that would limit countries’ power to offer sweeteners to large corporations. 
Other smaller states, led by Ireland, have blocked a common tax on digital revenues. This has pushed several countries, including France, Italy and Spain, to adopt similar levies at national level, despite risks this could weaken the EU market. 
A new attempt for a watered-down EU-wide digital tax could be made in coming weeks, but has little chance of succeeding. 
In proposing an EU-wide digital tax last year, Brussels said the levy was needed to restore fair competition in the bloc and end practices that allow large multinationals such as Google, Facebook or Amazon to cut their tax bills by moving their continental profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg or Ireland. 
Germany and France, the two largest states in the EU, supported the commission’s plan to decide by majority on some tax matters. In a joint news conference with his French peer, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the reform was needed to improve decision-making in the EU.

Banks may focus on that segment while the purchase mortgage market slows because of rising interest rates and diminished affordability.
Blend is the latest example of a tech start-up that works with banks, rather than competing against them, to bring easier-to-use digital services to the financial industry. The traditional mortgage industry is also competing with online offerings like Quicken Loans' Rocket Mortgage, which has helped that lender gain market share.
The home equity loan or line of credit application takes about 20 minutes via a bank's mobile phone app or website, according to Blend, and documents that need to be signed are sent digitally. The company gets a fee for every loan that is successfully closed through its software.
Blend, which has 130 banks and credit unions as clients, including giants like Wells Fargo, was founded in 2012 and is backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Greylock Partners. It was valued at about $500 million in 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Lynn Heitman, an executive vice president at U.S. Bank, said they partnered with Blend to ""simplify and streamline the banking experience for our customers to help them achieve their goals,"" from home renovations to debt consolidation, she said.
The industry isn't done fixing the loan process, according to Ghamsari. The goal for Blend is to simplify the application into a ""one-tap"" approval process, reminiscent of the ""one-click"" purchasing tool that Amazon pioneered in the world of e-commerce.
""The process of being approved for these loans and lines will be one-tap within the next five years,"" he said. ""And the ability to check out will be as simple as, here's your remaining items we couldn't do automatically. Those things will be embedded in a one-stop shop for the consumer. Those things are coming."""

The play was actually made by Stephon Gilmore, who corralled a duck from Jared Goff for an interception that all but wrapped up a 13-3 win for the Patriots.
But, if not for Hoyer, New England defensive coordinator Brian Flores may have never called the blitz that forced Goff to just throw it up for grabs and Gilmore may have never used the technique that helped him make the play.
The MMQB's Albert Breer explained how Hoyer's experience with Sean McVay's offense (and his streaming subscriptions) helped the Patriots defense make the game-changing play.

 (Photo: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports)
Hoyer began his career in New England, but he got his first shot as a starter in Cleveland. In 2014, his second year there, he started 11 games for coordinator Kyle Shanahan, then played for Shanahan again in San Francisco in '17. Rams coach Sean McVay coached tight ends for Mike and Kyle Shanahan in Washington from 2010-13, which led Hoyer to believe he'd have some institutional knowledge of McVay's offense.
Before the Super Bowl, he watched an episode of Peyton Manning's Detail series on ESPN-Plus on Goff, and it hit him right away- the offense is the same. Looking at the Rams tape confirmed it. … Then, Hoyer went back to Amazon's All or Nothing series on the Rams; it was about the 2016 season but had footage of OTAs from McVay's first spring there. Hoyer recognized the language.
FOOTBALL FIX:NFL news delivered to your inbox
Having played in the McVay/Shanahan system, Hoyer knew all the dirty little secrets of the offense, including its fatal flaw ... 
""Having played in that offense, they don't have an answer for all-out pressure,"" Hoyer says. ""Their answer is for the quarterback to make a play.""
Hoyer's contribution did not end there. While acting as the scout-team QB, he gave the New England secondary a tip regarding those all-out pressures that would lead directly to Gilmore's interception.
""We were all up there [showing an all-out blitz]the way everyone's been seeing us, moving around,"" Devin [McCourty] says. ""And Hoyer said, 'If I'm the quarterback, I'm just going to catch the ball and throw it deep-all of you are close, so I'm throwing it deep.' Sure enough, that week, we started seeing it more. Kansas City did it. Green Bay hit us with it.""
The adjustment, as Jason explained it, was for those in coverage, at the snap, to ""play off and read the quarterback.""
Fast-forward to the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIII. The Patriots dialed up the type of all-out blitz that Hoyer said would give the Rams problems. Gilmore played off coverage with his eyes fixed on Goff right from the snap.
Goff's reacted to the pressure by just lobbing up a backfoot throw. Gilmore saw it all the way and made one of the easier interceptions of his career. He can thank Hoyer for that.

A company email sent in December and viewed by The Wall Street Journal listed 550 items that would see increases. The company said that it has been forced into the move by suppliers charging more due to inflation. The average increase for items on the list was 66 cents.
Prices also rose this month on an additional 50 items, as 700 contracts to sell certain goods at low prices expired. The new, higher levels on those items will bring Whole Foods hundreds of thousands of dollars per week in additional revenue.
Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017 in order to finally get a foothold in the grocery business and to give the primarily-online company a bricks-and-mortar presence. After acquiring the high-end grocery store, Amazon cut prices and started offering perks to Amazon Prime members. More recently they announced the end of the younger, hipper, cheaper Whole Foods “365” stores, saying prices would be cheaper across all Whole Foods locations so the concept was unnecessary.
A Whole Foods spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal that the store would still offer “hundreds to thousands” of sale items daily, and continue to strive to lower costs for Prime members and all shoppers."

 Siriano's show at 30 Rockefeller Plaza drew celebrities, influencers, and industry elites.

 A few days before the show, 360-degree photos are taken of each look (Siriano had 57), which helps the app's machine-learning tools recognize the outfits through a phone's camera as they come down the runway day of. The app then prompts the user to give it a thumbs up or a heart. 
 As of right now, there is no ""see now, buy now"" feature, though SAP sees it as a potential asset later. 
 Yet, it's what the app offers to designers that may be its best quality: Designers can also use the Runway App to go back and review the feedback data to determine what could work in department stores as consumers head to the racks. According to SAP, the app helps ""brands to increase margins by understanding what's loved in real-time and avoid investment in unpopular designs."" 
 The primary capacity of SAP's Runway App for users is the favoriting feature. But how is that any different than taking a photo of a look that stands out to you? 
 The app is attempting to break a convention already set in stone, one rather already simplistic nonetheless, in the fashion world: the camera function. Why go through an app when you can merely swipe left on your iPhone's home screen? A fashionista's camera roll is already a collection of her favorites. Without the ""see now, buy now"" option, the app's appeal to the average runway attendee seems uncertain. 
 Not to mention, SAP's Runway App design is rather primitive in nature and battery-draining: I had to quickly shift to low-battery mode during Siriano's show while using the app and ended up with 1% at the end. For someone attending more than one show, this would be a buzzkill. 
 Similar to how the fashion houses experiment with new looks during fashion week, SAP seems to be doing the same thing with its software — trying to better understand how to appeal to consumers while helping out the businesses behind the experience. The company did not immediately respond when asked how many people used the app during Siriano's show Saturday. 
 Whether stars like Christina Hendricks, Mariska Hargitay, or Deborah Messing, who were in attendance, were using the Runway App is unknown... but seems unlikely. Unlike the rest of the attendees, their phones remained relatively out of sight. 
Take a look at how SAP's Runway App works:"

The partnership with Goat, which was seen as a threat to the footwear industry, marries the leading sportswear retailer with the largest secondary marketplace for authentic sneakers, Goat Group's Eddy Lu said on ""Closing Bell.""
""As we started to chat, we realized that ... our consumers shop at both [Goat and Foot Locker], so we really saw the partnership as really bridging the primary and secondary markets,"" said Lu, who co-founded the company in 2015. The group also includes the Fight Club consignment shop, which was launched more than 13 years ago.
Foot Locker, which has a market cap of $6.4 billion and runs more than 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores across the globe, is looking to leverage technology to improve the customer experience and target younger shoppers, the company said in announcing the deal last week. Lu said the move also gives Goat the opportunity to build an in-store presence. Foot Locker can be found in just about any shopping center.

Goat is known among sneaker collectors for delivering ""high-heat"" and ""limited-edition products,"" with more than 40 percent of its gear being sold ""under retail prices,"" Lu said. He hopes the deal can take advantage of online and retail sales as sneakers gain mainstream attention with giants like Nike collaborating with fashion designer Virgil Abloh's Off-White label and Adidas working with hip hop artists Kanye West and Pharrell.
""So if you think about it, they bring their prowess in retail and we bring our expertise in digital. And because they're a global marketplace, [there are] a lot of partnerships and a lot of synergies that can happen from that,"" Lu said.

LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil company are tightening the global oil market and sending refiners around the world scrambling to find replacements for the country's diesel-rich heavy and extra heavy crudes.
Venezuela's heavy crudes, such as Merey, have few close substitutes, with the nearest being grades such as Brazil's Marlim, Mexico's Maya, Canada's Bow River and Cold Lake, or Iraq's Basra Heavy.
Most of those crudes have an even higher sulphur content than Venezuela's, which will require extra processing to make fuels of acceptable quality, and in any event the quantities are limited in the short term.
Venezuela sanctions have arrived in a market that was already likely to be short of medium and heavy crudes because of U.S. sanctions on Iran and OPEC's output cuts.
The major oil exporters in the Middle East Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran) market mostly medium and heavy crudes.
U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, together with OPEC's output cuts, have therefore removed mostly medium and heavy oils from the market, leaving lighter grades relatively unaffected.
The result is that prices of medium and heavy crudes have surged relative to their lighter counterparts since the middle of January.
Mars, a medium crude grade from the U.S. Gulf, has moved to a rare premium over Louisiana Light Sweet. Oman, another medium crude, has moved to a premium over Brent, a light one.
DECADES OF FAILURE
Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, amounting to around 300 billion barrels, ahead of Saudi Arabia on 265 billion and Canada at 170 billion (""Statistical review of world energy"", BP, 2018).
But the country's oil industry has been in relative and absolute decline for the last 50 years as problems of producing and marketing its heavy crudes have been compounded by an unattractive investment regime and mismanagement.
Venezuela's crude production slumped from 3.8 million barrels per day in 1970 to just 1.7 million bpd in 1985, recovering to 3.4 million bpd in 1998 before slumping again to 2.1 million bpd in 2017.
Venezuela accounted for 16 percent of OPEC output and 8 percent of world production in 1970 but those percentages had fallen to just 5 percent and 2 percent respectively by 2017 (https://tmsnrt.rs/2E4Pfb9).
The country's very dense crudes, some of which barely float on water, are complicated to process and sell for a large discount compared to other producers.
Production has been hampered by corruption, political interference and lack of foreign investment and technology to maintain existing fields and develop new ones.
Like Iran, another founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela's oil industry has been blighted by mismanagement, unrest, political instability, diplomatic isolation and sanctions.
Output has gone into free fall as the country's isolation has increased, shrinking from 2.4 million bpd in 2016 to 2.0 million bpd in 2017 and 1.5 million bpd in 2018, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative.
Venezuela was once a major oil exporter to the United States, but shipments have fallen from 1.4 million bpd in 1998 to around 500,000 bpd in 2018 (""Petroleum supply monthly"", EIA, Jan 2019).
Venezuela's diminished importance in the global oil market and as a supplier to the United States has emboldened the U.S. administration to take a tough approach in attempting to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro.
Sanctions announced last month prohibit U.S. corporations and persons from financial transactions with state-owned oil company PDVSA.
The U.S. Treasury's guidance, which appears deliberately unclear, has left many third-country buyers uncertain about whether they can do business with PDVSA without also falling foul of sanctions.
HEAVY OIL SHORTAGE
The U.S. administration likely calculated any fallout from sanctions on oil prices would be small given the limited volumes of crude involved and the expectation that the standoff would be resolved quickly.
But while Venezuela's crude now accounts for a very limited share of the global oil market, it plays a much more important role in the niche market for heavy crude.
Venezuela accounted for 1 million bpd of heavy-sour crude production out of a worldwide total of 7 million bpd in 2017 (""World Oil Review"", ENI, 2018).
Heavy crudes are much harder to refine and tend to contain significant quantities of sulphur and other impurities that are costly to remove, which is why they sell at a hefty discount to medium and light oils.
For refineries that have invested in delayed coking units, however, heavy crudes can yield large volumes of middle distillates (gasoil, diesel and jet fuel).
Middle distillates are used mostly in freight transportation as well as manufacturing, mining and farming, and are particularly valuable late in the business cycle when economic activity is near to the peak.
Mid-distillates are especially prized at the moment with the forthcoming introduction of new bunker fuel regulations by the International Maritime Organization from the start of 2020.
In effect, sanctions have shifted the balance of global oil production in the direction of lighter crudes, at the same time that the economy and forthcoming regulations are pushing refinery demand towards heavier grades.
The sudden embargo on Venezuela's exports has therefore sent refiners in the United States and elsewhere scrambling to find alternative supplies compatible with their equipment.
If refiners are unable to source enough heavy and extra heavy crude, they will buy the next best alternative, in this case medium density crudes, so the impact of sanctions is rippling through the entire oil market.

But there are a few areas where your local grocery store or a big box store like Walmart and Target can offer better value for your money.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
That's especially true when it comes to size. Because Costco generally sells products in bulk, to get the most out of your purchase, you need to make sure you can consume the larger quantities of a product before it goes bad. For ordinary families or individuals, that can be a high bar to clear.
That's primarily why Charlene Haugsven, founder of MyFrugalAdventures.com, tells CNBC Make It, ""Just because Costco has it doesn't mean it's a bargain.""
Here are the eight types of groceries she and other experts suggest that the average shopper should think twice before buying in bulk at Costco:
Breakfast cereal
Ground coffee
Condiments and sauces, such as soy sauce
Flour
Milk
Eggs
Fresh fruits and vegetables
Spices
If you compare these items, especially the Kirkland brand, to similar products you'd find at the grocery store simply on price, Costco usually wins. However, the reason grocery experts put these items in the ""don't buy"" category comes down to the size.
The containers or packages are simply too big to end up being a good value for the average person.
Sure, some folks with big families, an extra freezer or lots of pantry space may think these are a good deal. In many cases, though, you'll end up throwing a good portion of the food away or struggle to find room for it in your home.
""A normal family is just never going to get through the quantity you have to purchase,"" Haugsven says. That's especially true on items like soy sauce, spice mixes and produce. If you live by yourself, springing for Costco's 1-pound container of fresh spinach, for example, may not make sense, though it is a steal at $4.99. That's because, even if it's stored properly, fresh spinach will usually only last 5 to 7 days in the refrigerator, according to shelf-life guide site StillTasty.com.
Large quantities can also be unwieldy to store. Though grocery stores usually sell flour in 5-pound sacks, Costco sells it in 25-pound packages, and it can be difficult to find space for all of that. ""I would never want to store 25 pounds of flour. That's a whole year's worth of flour in advance,"" Haugsven says."

Muellers report Barr has said his goal will be to provide as much transparency as he can consistent with the law but hes also said that Muellers conclusions will be handled as a confidential document and emphasized that Justice Department guidelines discourage the disclosure of negative information about people who are not being charged with crimes DOJ guidelines say that a sitting president cannot be indicted The new poll finds that a 61 percent majority of Americans would support Congress impeaching the president and trying to remove him from office if Muellers report says Trump authorized his 2016 campaign to coordinate with the Russian government That includes 29 percent of Republicans Overall 33 percent would oppose impeaching Trump even if Mueller finds that Trump authorized collusion with Russia which the president vigorously denies including 67 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents Right now 51 percent approve of Muellers handling of the investigation with 34 percent disapproving Thats essentially unchanged from a similar question asked a year ago Meanwhile 35 percent approve of Trumps response to Muellers investigation with 52 percent disapproving There are a significant number of people keeping an open mind about what the report will ultimately conclude said Mark Rozell dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University which partnered with The Post on the pollAttitudes toward Trump and Mueller contrast sharply with views of President Clinton and Ken Starr before the independent counsel released his report 20 years ago Scott Clement and Matt Zapotosky note An August 1998 PostABC poll found 61 percent of Americans said Starr was mainly interested in hurting Clinton while 35 percent said he was mainly interested in finding the truth The new poll finds views of Mueller are flipped in the positive direction with 57 percent saying he is mainly interested in finding the truth compared with 36 percent who say hes mainly interested in hurting Trump Both polls today and in 1998 show people who affiliate with the presidents party overwhelmingly see investigations as politically motivated but independents lean differently this year A 57 percent majority of independents think Mueller is mainly interested in finding the truth compared with 1998 when 59 percent of independents thought Starr was mainly interested in causing political damage to Clinton The publics desire for transparency and Barrs unwillingness to promise hell provide it sets the stage for a potentially titanic clash between Congress and the executive branch in the months to comeLowell Weicker who as a Republican representing Connecticut was a member of the Senate Watergate Committee says Congress must be willing to go to the mat to force the release of the report if Barr stonewalls This decision should not be left to the attorney general alone even if it means using congressional tools from subpoena power to the appropriations process to make the report public Weicker now an independent wrote in an oped last week I dont know what Mueller has found or will find But I know that if the president is as innocent as he has argued from day one then he should want Muellers report to be public and transparent rather than rebutted and censored as Rudolph W Giuliani the presidents lawyer has suggested he will doThe Posts Editorial Board has endorsed legislation introduced by Sens Chuck Grassley RIowa and Dick Blumenthal DConn that would require public reports from Mueller and every other subsequent special counsel The Special Counsel Transparency Act would require that a report be sent to Congress at the conclusion of an investigation or within two weeks of a removal transfer or resignation It would need to include all factual findings and underlying evidenceThe Mueller probe is not just another criminal investigation an editorial notedover the weekendIt is also an inquiry into a foreign attack on the nations democratic system the details of which are the publics to know and an inquest into official malfeasance at some of the highest levels of government If the air can be cleared it must be To be clear not every potentially unflattering detail Mr Mueller dredges up needs to be on the record But core conclusions and evidence must be And because special

With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro
THE BIG IDEA: Americans across the partisan divide believe strongly and overwhelmingly that special counsel Bob Muellers final report on his investigation should be made public in its entirety, and a 56 percent majority trusts Muellers version of the facts more than President Trumps, according to a new Washington Post-Schar School poll.
The survey finds that 81 percent of adults nationally believe Muellers report should be released, including 79 percent of Republicans. Overall, 64 percent of respondents said they feel strongly that the report must be made public. Just 15 percent think it should not be published.
These numbers are striking because Trumps attorney general nominee, William Barr, who is poised to be confirmed by the full Senate this week on a largely party-line vote, has pointedly declined to commit to releasing Muellers report. Barr has said his goal will be to provide as much transparency as he can consistent with the law, but hes also said that Muellers conclusions will be handled as a confidential document and emphasized that Justice Department guidelines discourage the disclosure of negative information about people who are not being charged with crimes. (DOJ guidelines say that a sitting president cannot be indicted.)
-- The new poll finds that a 61 percent majority of Americans would support Congress impeaching the president and trying to remove him from office if Muellers report says Trump authorized his 2016 campaign to coordinate with the Russian government. That includes 29 percent of Republicans. Overall, 33 percent would oppose impeaching Trump even if Mueller finds that Trump authorized collusion with Russia, which the president vigorously denies, including 67 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents.
-- Right now, 51 percent approve of Muellers handling of the investigation, with 34 percent disapproving. Thats essentially unchanged from a similar question asked a year ago. Meanwhile, 35 percent approve of Trumps response to Muellers investigation, with 52 percent disapproving. There are a significant number of people keeping an open mind about what the report will ultimately conclude, said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, which partnered with The Post on the poll.
--Attitudes toward Trump and Mueller contrast sharply with views of President Clinton and Ken Starr before the independent counsel released his report 20 years ago, Scott Clement and Matt Zapotosky note: An August 1998 Post-ABC poll found 61 percent of Americans said Starr was mainly interested in hurting Clinton while 35 percent said he was mainly interested in finding the truth. The new poll finds views of Mueller are flipped in the positive direction, with 57 percent saying he is mainly interested in finding the truth compared with 36 percent who say hes mainly interested in hurting Trump. Both polls today and in 1998 show people who affiliate with the presidents party overwhelmingly see investigations as politically motivated, but independents lean differently this year. A 57 percent majority of independents think Mueller is mainly interested in finding the truth, compared with 1998, when 59 percent of independents thought Starr was mainly interested in causing political damage to Clinton.
-- The publics desire for transparency and Barrs unwillingness to promise hell provide it sets the stage for a potentially titanic clash between Congress and the executive branch in the months to come.
Lowell Weicker, who as a Republican representing Connecticut was a member of the Senate Watergate Committee, says Congress must be willing to go to the mat to force the release of the report if Barr stonewalls. This decision should not be left to the attorney general alone, even if it means using congressional tools from subpoena power to the appropriations process to make the report public, Weicker, now an independent, wrote in an op-ed last week. I dont know what Mueller has found or will find But I know that if the president is as innocent as he has argued from day one, then he should want Muellers report to be public and transparent, rather than rebutted and censored as Rudolph W. Giuliani, the presidents lawyer, has suggested he will do.
The Posts Editorial Board has endorsed legislation introduced by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.) that would require public reports from Mueller and every other subsequent special counsel. The Special Counsel Transparency Act would require that a report be sent to Congress at the conclusion of an investigation or within two weeks of a removal, transfer, or resignation. It would need to include all factual findings and underlying evidence.
The Mueller probe is not just another criminal investigation, an editorial noted over the weekend. It is also an inquiry into a foreign attack on the nations democratic system, the details of which are the publics to know, and an inquest into official malfeasance at some of the highest levels of government. If the air can be cleared, it must be. To be clear, not every potentially unflattering detail Mr. Mueller dredges up needs to be on the record. But core conclusions and evidence must be. And because special counsel investigations are rare and involve serious questions of official wrongdoing, the public will have a similar interest in transparency in later special counsel probes, as well. The bill should pass and quickly.

A DEAL IS REACHED:
-- Key lawmakers reached a tentative compromise last night to avoid another government shutdown at the end of the week. Hurdles remained, and Trumps ultimate backing was in doubt after quick opposition emerged from conservatives, Erica Werner, Damian Paletta and Sean Sullivan report:
The deal includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fences along the border, compared with $5.7 billion Trump had sought for more than 200 miles of walls. The deal omits a strict new cap Democrats had sought on immigrants detained within the United States as opposed to at the border. At the same time, it limits overall levels of detention beds maintained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, although GOP aides said ICE would have enough money and flexibility to maintain its current detention levels and add more when needed. ...
White House officials were reviewing the terms of the deal, and [Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)] said he was hopeful Trump would be supportive. But Fox News host Sean Hannity, a Trump confidant, immediately called the shutdown deal a garbage compromise. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who talks regularly with Trump, said that it fails to address serious threats. ... At a rally in El Paso on Monday night, Trump told a crowd of supporters that he was briefed on the conference committees progress as he was walking onstage. Just so you know were building the wall anyway, Trump declared to the audience.
-- Nancy Pelosi signed off on the agreement, per House Appropriations Committee Chairman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.). 
-- This deal would fund all government operations through September.  
-- If a shutdown still occurs on Friday night, though, the administration reassured Americans yesterday that they will still get their tax refunds. CNNs Donna Borak reports: If funding lapses again on Friday, the IRS will follow [a] contingency plan put in place in January, including a revised protocol to accommodate the tax filing season.
-- Trump and potential 2020 candidate Beto ORourke staged dueling rallies in El Paso last night. In a meandering, 75-minute speech, Trump tried to paint an image of crime and lawlessness on the border while claiming falsely that violent crime went down in El Paso after a wall was built, Philip Rucker, Toluse Olorunnipa and Jenna Johnson report. Pausing to listen to chants of Build that wall!, Trump sought to correct his supporters: Now, you really mean finish the wall, he said, claiming that his promised border wall was already under construction. He referred to ORourke several times during the rally, calling the former congressman a young man whos got very little going for himself.
About a mile down the road, several thousand demonstrators gathered at a high school carrying American flags, rainbow banners, Beto for President flags, and flags for Mexico and Texas. There were also signs decrying Trump and his border wall such as Trump made America hate again and chants from the crowd that included Make tacos, not walls!
-- A Trump supporter attacked a cameraman during the presidents rally, per the BBC: Sporting a Make America Great Again cap, the man shoved and swore at the BBC's Ron Skeans and other news crews before being pulled away. Mr Skeans said the very hard shove came from his blindside. Mr Trump saw the attack and confirmed Mr Skeans was well with a thumbs up after it happened. A campaign official for Mr Trump afterwards suggested the attacker was drunk.

THERES A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
-- The National Enquirers parent company, American Media, sought advice last year from the Justice Department over whether it should register as a foreign agent after publishing a magazine celebrating the Saudi crown prince. The Wall Street Journals Julie Bykowicz and Lukas Alpert scoop: The company told Justice Department officials in the letter that although it followed the editorial and photography suggestions of [an adviser to the Saudis], it wasnt under any contractual obligation to do so. The publisher also told the Justice Department that it didnt receive any foreign money to produce the magazine. Based on those assertions, the Justice Department said the media company didnt need to register as a foreign agent, noting that conclusion could change if the facts in the matter are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.
-- Former White House aide Cliff Sims is suing Trump after the presidents attorneys claimed Simss new book violated a nondisclosure agreement. Josh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez: Mark Zaid, a lawyer representing Sims, said [Trump] is trying to use a nondisclosure agreement from the campaign to punish Sims for discussing his time in the White House. ... The lawsuit accuses Trump of having his campaign serve as 'an illegitimate cutout and step into the shoes' of the government in an attempt to silence Sims, in violation of his First Amendment rights. ... It claims that the U.S. government, 'for the first time ever through the use of private surrogates, is seeking to unconstitutionally censor and punish a former federal employee for disclosing unclassified information outlining what he saw and observed during his time in the White House.' ... Sims signed an NDA during his time working for the Trump campaign but does not know whether he signed an additional White House agreement regarding 'confidential' information, according to the lawsuit, which states that Sims is operating under the assumption that he did sign such a document.""
THE NEW CONGRESS:
-- Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) apologized after a number of her Democratic colleagues, including Pelosi, rebuked her over a tweet widely criticized as anti-Semitic. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: The Minnesota congresswomans Sunday evening tweet Its all about the Benjamins baby, a reference to $100 bills drew immediate denunciations from Republicans and fellow Democrats, especially Jewish members of Congress. Within hours, [the speaker] and the leadership issued a joint statement calling Omars use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israels supporters deeply offensive and insisted on an apology. In response, Omar said her intention was never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. This is why I unequivocally apologize. The firestorm exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party over the unquestioned U.S. support of Israel, pitting long-standing Democratic backers of the Jewish state against the partys newest lawmakers and several 2020 presidential candidates who have spoken out in favor of Palestinian rights.
-- Rookie mistake: The publication and subsequent retraction of a fact sheet from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs office about the Green New Deal has given ample fodder for the president and conservatives to mock her resolution and the 2020 Democrats who have endorsed it. Jeff Stein and David Weigel report: Ocasio-Cortezs staff posted online and sent to reporters a list of frequently asked questions about the Green New Deal. Those pages included language and policies not included in the resolution itself such as providing economic security to those unwilling to work and ruling out nuclear power as part of the solution to the climate crisis. None of the lawmakers or candidates signed off on the FAQ, which was prepared by Ocasio-Cortezs staff to explain the separate Green New Deal resolution but was accidentally released prematurely with unfinished language. The confusion over the document complicated the rollout of the Green New Deal plan, as more than a dozen media outlets, particularly in the conservative media, reported on policies in the FAQ page that the co-signers of the resolution have not agreed to support.
-- Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said he would no longer put his assets in a blind trust despite doing so for eight years as governor. The Tampa Bay Timess Steve Contorno reports: Scott said Monday that instead he will report his assets to the public in annual financial disclosure forms required of all members of Congress. Scott, the former head of a health care company before a scandalous exit, was the wealthiest governor in state history. His state financial disclosure report filed late on a Friday evening last June showed Scott had a net worth of more than $232 million at the end of 2017.
RICHMOND IS REELING:
-- Four members of his staff resigned after Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) refused to do so himself following two sexual assault allegations against him, leaving him with a skeleton crew as he fights for his survival. Laura Vozzella, Gregory S. Schneider and Fenit Nirappil have the latest: An attempt by Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) to introduce articles of impeachment against Fairfax was shut down by House Democrats after an emotional conference call Sunday night, in which they debated the proper procedure and viability of such a plan, given that the alleged offenses which Fairfax describes as consensual did not take place during his tenure as lieutenant governor The law firm where Fairfax has been a partner since September, Morrison &amp; Foerster, has hired an outside firm to conduct its own investigation into the allegations, and Fairfax has taken a paid leave of absence while it is pending. ...
Members of the Black Caucus, who have called on [Ralph] Northam to step down, said the first test of the governors rhetoric [that he is now committed to racial justice] is the spending plan the biggest legislation they face this year. And, they said, it doesnt measure up. Where Northam had initially proposed increasing the amount of Earned Income Tax Credit returned to low-income working families, the compromise deal eliminates that idea. The budget proposals tied to the package are stingier in many categories that affect low-income and minority communities ... With that, all 16 members of the Black Caucus voted against the tax bill, joined by a handful of other Democrats to deprive it of the 80 votes needed to go into immediate effect ...
Members of the Black Caucus met with Republican leadership including Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) and eventually swung around and supported the House version of the bill. But they said they did so only after securing verbal commitments to pursue funding in the state budget for areas that affect low-income and minority populations. That could happen either through amendments to the budget bill, the tax bill or in budget negotiations between the two chambers.
Neomi Rao testifies during her confirmation hearing last week. (Zach Gibson/Getty Images)
THE #METOO MOVEMENT:
-- Neomi Rao, Trumps nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, apologized for her controversial writings about date rape in college that gave some Republican pause. Seung Min Kim reports: In a letter Monday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Rao condemned 'sexual assault in all forms' as 'abhorrent' and stressed that she 'particularly regret[s] the insensitivity demonstrated in my remarks on rape and sexual assault.' She said that in college, she was 'sheltered' and that her perspective on the issue evolved as she grew more mature and became a mother to two children. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who recently disclosed her own experience with sexual assault and expressed hesitation about Rao, said she felt a lot better after sitting down with her. I havent made that firm commitment yet [on her nomination], but Im just glad to know where she stands, and it allayed a lot of fears, Ernst said.
-- The family of Barry Myers, Trumps nominee to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, paid a $290,000 fine after a federal agency found that their company, AccuWeather, subjected female employees to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. Myers is the former chief executive of AccuWeather. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: The agreement alleges that AccuWeather did not exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct the improper treatment and harassment against women there. AccuWeather denies the allegations of harassment in the letter. However, as part of the agreement, the company promised to institute a number of changes including mandatory in-person training for managers in how to identify and prevent unlawful harassment.
-- The Cleveland Browns have signed Kareem Hunt, the running back who was cut by the Kansas City Chiefs last year because he shoved and kicked a woman. Mark Maske reports: Its not clear when Hunt, 23, will play for the Browns. He faces a potential suspension without pay by the NFL next season under its personal conduct policy. We fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareems history and do not condone his actions,' Browns General Manager John Dorsey said ... We believe he deserves a second chance but certainly with the understanding that he has to go through critical and essential steps to become a performing member of this organization.
-- The sexual abuse scandal within the Southern Baptist church has prompted calls for criminal investigations and drawn comparisons to the Catholic Church.Julie Zauzmer and Marisa Iati report: The truth is that this is a cultural problem, said Marci Hamilton, the chief executive of anti-abuse nonprofit organization CHILD USA. It goes across every single organization where any adult has had access to children alone. No prosecutor at this point could possibly believe there are parts of society where this didnt happen. It did. Alabama and Mississippi, two states with the largest concentration of churches in the Southern Baptist Convention, have some of the shortest limitations on prosecuting child-sex crimes, Hamilton said. Neither state has a large Catholic population, so the Southern Baptist investigation may bring more pressure to change those laws.

2020 WATCH:
-- Iowa Democrats inched closer to adopting a new, optional tele-caucus that would vastly grow the number of people who vote in the states caucuses. Matt Viser reports: The state party plan, which still must pass muster with the Democratic National Committee, marks the most significant change to the caucus process since its inception in 1972 and seems likely to complicate the campaigns strategies. Although party officials dont have estimates, the move could significantly increase the number of voters involved. Not all of the details have been sorted out, but party officials say the voting will take place over a phone or smart device. Party leaders have been conscious of any change that would make the caucus seem like a primary, which would provoke officials in New Hampshire, where state law requires them to hold the nations first primary. Iowa Democrats checked their proposal by New Hampshire before announcing it. 
-- Recalling Bernie Sanderss boasts of his average 2016 contribution being $27, Democratic candidates are fighting to build the strongest small-dollar donor bases. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: Historically, these early low-dollar contributions were viewed largely as a sign of grass-roots support and an indication of potential voter enthusiasm. But that has changed in recent elections as small contributions have increasingly filled the coffers of many candidates providing the fuel that allows them to be viable contenders. Being able to raise a lot of money from a lot of small donors is now a test not only of a candidates ability to tap this source of funds, but to go head-to-head against [Trump] and his army of grass-roots donors.
-- Many Democratic strategists are expressing skepticism about Joe Bidens possible presidential bid. McClatchys Alex Roarty reports: McClatchy interviewed 31 Democratic strategists pollsters, opposition research experts, media consultants, ex-party officials, and communications specialists from across the country about a potential Biden campaign. Strikingly, these conversations yielded a similar view: The Democratic political community is more broadly and deeply pessimistic about Bidens potential candidacy than is commonly known. While these strategists said they respect Biden, they cited significant disadvantages for his campaign from the increasingly liberal and non-white Democratic electorate to policy baggage from his years in the Senate and a field of rivals that includes new, fresh-faced candidates. We heard it with Hillary, and we saw it happened, [one Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist said]. And theres a lot of reason to think he would wind up a significantly weaker candidate than Hillary.
-- If Biden decides to run, his wife, Jill, could become his most important surrogate. From Roxanne Roberts: After Trump was elected, it looked like the Bidens might finally retire from public life. They bought a $2 million house in Rehoboth. They established foundations on global diplomacy and cancer research. But the siren song of the White House, that ultimate and elusive prize, still calls to Joe. According to those closest to the Bidens, he really wants to run. Jill never aspired to be first lady Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Joe when he was vice president, says Jill would be a critical asset in the campaign. Klain says she connects with people in an authentic way as an advocate for education and especially military families.
-- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is heading to New Hampshire as he considers a 2020 run.Politicos Sally Goldenberg reports: De Blasio is ... soliciting City Hall staffers with national political experience and preparing to travel to the early primary state of New Hampshire this week.  There he will meet with Mayor Jim Donchess and may chat with locals at a diner... De Blasio has repeatedly said he is not ruling out a run and has long sought a national platform. But City Hall officials have privately lamented a de Blasio push for a higher national profile, worried it would generate negative headlines and distract de Blasio from his day job.
-- Sen. Amy Klobuchars Republican colleagues have praised her dealmaking abilities but have also expressed concern that such praise might hurt her chances. Politicos Burgess Everett and Marianne Levine report: In a Democratic caucus filled with presidential hopefuls taking a hard line against [Trumps] presidency, the Minnesota senator's brand of pragmatic politics stands out. And numerous Republicans are raving about Klobuchar her personality, her respect for the other party, even her competitiveness in a general election. In fact, a dozen GOP senators were so effusive in interviews this month that some worried they might damage her candidacy in a Democratic nomination fight that has many candidates embracing the partys left flank. CNN will host a town hall with Klobuchar in New Hampshire next Monday.
-- Klobuchar also became the latest Democratic candidate to say she would reject corporate PAC money. From CNBCs Brian Schwartz: Klobuchar has been no stranger to contributions from corporate PACs during her runs for Minnesota's Senate seat. In her 2018 re-election campaign, she raked in just under a quarter of her total haul from PACs, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
-- A split has emerged among Democratic 2020 candidates over whether to pursue Obama-esque hope and optimism or prepare for an all-out fight against Trump. The New York Timess Alexander Burns reports: Down one path, [Cory] Bookers, lies a mission of healing and hope, with a campaign to bind up social wounds that have deepened in the Trump era. The other path, [Elizabeth] Warrens, promises combat and more combat a crusade not just to defeat Mr. Trump but to demolish the architecture of his government. It is perhaps not an accident that the most confident Democratic tribunes of good feeling are all men, while the partys sternest warriors are mainly women. In a contest for the presidency, a position traditionally viewed in martial terms, it may be easier for a man of Mr. Bidens backslapping swagger or Mr. Bookers athletic stature to show tenderness or vulnerability without fear of appearing weak.
-- Kirsten Gillibrand said the first Womens March pulled her out of a deep depression after Trumps election. Now, as a woman, for women is the main theme of her 2020 campaign.From the Timess Lisa Lerer and Shane Goldmacher: By using her gender to find a toehold in the Democratic electorate, Ms. Gillibrand risks pigeonholing herself in a race where voters may be seeking a broader populist message. There may well be a risk, Ms. Gillibrand said, in what she calls her women plus campaign platform. But it is who I am. I think the country would be so much stronger if women had greater voices. There is no real precedent for Ms. Gillibrands strategy: As a candidate, Hillary Clinton struggled to talk about her gender, and essentially tried to copy the approach of the male presidential candidates who had preceded her.
-- Tommy Hicks Jr., a longtime friend of the presidents family who became chair of the pro-Trump groups America First Policies and America First Action, has been named co-chair of the RNC. BuzzFeed Newss Tarini Parti reports: Coordination rules governing how much outside groups can communicate with the campaign and elected officials had been limiting Hicks relationship with the president. In his new role, Hicks can now be more directly involved and play a larger role, especially with the presidents 2020 campaign creating a structure in which the RNCs operations are intertwined with its own. The setup is shaping up to be dramatically different from the 2016 election when the campaigns relationship with the RNC was more of a forced merger, Hicks said.

CNNs Maeve Reston reports: In an interview with The Breakfast Club hosts DJ Envy and Charlamagne Tha God that aired Monday, the show's hosts asked the California Democrat to address a series of derogatory memes that have circulated on social media. One of the hosts cited a meme that said Harris is not African-American because her parents were immigrants born in India and Jamaica and she spent her high school years in Canada. So I was born in Oakland, and raised in the United States except for the years that I was in high school in Montreal, Canada, Harris responded with a laugh. I'm black, and I'm proud of being black, she said at a later point in the interview. I was born black. I will die black, and I'm not going to make excuses for anybody because they don't understand. ... The junior senator from California was also asked about criticism she has faced on social media for marrying a white man. 'Look, I love my husband, and he happened to be the one that I chose to marry, because I love himand that was that moment in time, and that's it,' Harris said. 'And he loves me,' she added laughing.""

Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)
Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezoss allegations the National Enquirer sought to extort and ""blackmail"" him could increase pressure on Congress to pass legislation to criminalize sharing graphic photos without the subjects consent.
Some federal lawmakers have been trying for years to pass legislation to crack down on nonconsensual pornography the distribution of private, sexually explicit images without the permission of those featured and sometimes colloquially referred to by law enforcement as revenge porn or sextortion.
Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) tells me in the coming months, she plans to reintroduce legislation cracking down on nonconsensual pornography, which was co-sponsored in 2017 by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).
The more people that are impacted by this vicious conduct will hopefully give us the traction we need to get some laws on the books that create the criminality of this, Speier said.
Though the distribution of nonconsensual pornography is an increasingly common issue, the circumstances surrounding Bezos are highly unusual. Last week, the Amazon chief accused the Enquirer of threatening to publish graphic photos, including one he said an executive at the tabloids parent company referred to as a below the belt selfie, unless Bezos halted an investigation into how the company obtained private messages between him and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez. 
Currently, 42 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books criminalizing the distribution of nonconsensual pornography. But the current patchwork of laws varies dramatically state by state, and some states have very weak protections for victims, said Mary Anne Franks, the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a non-profit focused on fighting online abuse. 
Speier said comprehensive federal legislation is needed given the damage this issue can cause to victims lives.
Theres no question that Bezos is in a rare position to be able to fight the release of such graphic material given his wealth and notoriety. But regular folks dont have those advantages even as ubiquitous smartphones and web cameras make it easier than ever to snap and potentially abuse intimate photos.
Hes not at anybody elses mercy, said Carrie Goldberg, a victims' rights attorney in Brooklyn, New York. He had the privilege of being able to call out his blackmailer. But I have a lot of clients who cant.
In the defiant Medium post where he published alleged emails from executives at Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., Bezos acknowledged his advantages. If in my position I cant stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can? Bezos wrote in a Medium post outlining the allegations.
One in eight social media users have been the targets of nonconsensual pornography, according to a 2017 report from the nonprofit Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. They are more likely to be female than male, according to Franks.
Technology companies themselves say they have been cracking down on the practice in recent years, and advocates said they worked with the companies to develop legislation they would support. Both Twitter and Facebook supported the legislation Speier co-sponsored, called the ENOUGH Act, when it was introduced in 2017.
But the legislation stalled amid opposition from civil liberties groups that raised concerns the bill could have a chilling effect on free speech. And they have opposed bills across the country with broad language limiting nonconsensual pornography because of the impact it could have on images that might have news value or be of historical interest.
Speier is confident she is in a better position to pass legislation during this session of Congress, especially with Democrats in control of the House.
We have strong values around privacy rights as a party, she told me.
A Lime electric scooter in Los Angeles on July 9, 2018. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)
BITS: The mother of a woman who has been in a vegetative state following a Lime electric scooter accident in December plans to sue the company on behalf of her daughter for negligence, The Washington Post's Peter Holley reported. Ashanti Jordan's accident occurred when she collided with a car at an intersection in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Todd R. Falzone, a lawyer who represents Tracy Jordan, Ashanti Jordan's mother, said the Lime app tells riders not to ride on sidewalks. He said Jordan was injured because she abided by Lime's instructions and therefore didn't ride on the sidewalk.
Im worried about people around the country who are riding these things and not understanding whether theyre supposed to be riding them on the street or on the sidewalk, Falzone said, according to my colleague. You rely on the company to know the local rules. Fort Lauderdale allows users to ride electric scooters on sidewalks but Florida law bans using motorized scooters on the street. Falzone said his client is seeking compensatory damages that cover potential disabilities, mental anguish, hospital expenses, as well as long-term medical care and loss of income, Peter reported.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 28, 2018. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)
NIBBLES: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) demanded that Apple and Google immediately remove an app from the Saudi government that can allow Saudi men to track Saudi women's travel and prevent them from leaving Saudi Arabia. Wyden made the request in a letter to Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai after Business Insider's Bill Bostock reported that Google Play and Apple's iTunes are hosting the app, which is called Absher. The app offers general functionalities but can also send SMS alerts when women travel.
By permitting the app in your respective stores, your companies are making it easier for Saudi men to control their family members from the convenience of their smartphones and restrict their movement, Wyden said in the letter. This flies in the face of the type of society you both claim to support and defend.
Human rights activists have also slammed the companies for hosting the service. Apple and Google have rules against apps that facilitate threats and harassment, Rothna Begum, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Business Insider. Apps like this one can facilitate human rights abuses, including discrimination against women. You can read the full report on the Absher app here.

BYTES: More than 30 advocacy groups questioned Facebook's commitment to helping fight the spread of disinformation before the European Parliament election this year, the Hill's Emily Birnbaum reported. The groups, which include Mozilla, Access Now and the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in an open letter that the company's recent code changes have blocked ad transparency tools that allow users to see how advertisers are targeting them. For instance, ProPublica reported last month that the social network's move blocked the investigative news outlet's own tool.

 Hannah Gaber Saletan, USA TODAY
WASHINGTON  Some time soon, the federal government will begin selling off what's left of Paul Manafort's life, a small fortune amassed through a decade of illicit lobbying work. When they do, the investigation into Russian election interference stands to breach an unusual milestone: bringing in more money than it has cost.
But first, lawyers working for special counsel Robert Mueller must reach a deal with another set of opponents, including the Trump Tower condo board.
A handful of banks the Trump Tower Residential Condominium Board have lined up to argue that they're entitled to parts of the properties and investment accounts valued at about $26.7 million that the former Trump campaign chairman has been forced to give up as part of plea agreement with Mueller's team. Included in the package of New York real estate is a $7.3 million compound in the Hamptons and a $3.8 million apartment in Manhattan's Trump Tower.
Many of the claims could be resolved as early as this week, according to court documents.
When they are, the investigation Trump has dismissed as a witch hunt and a waste of money will more or less have paid for itself. Mueller's probe has posted costs of about $25 million so far. Exactly how much the government stands to collect will turn on how much of his property must be turned over to banks and others, and to New York's fluctuating real estate market. 
In addition to Manafort's fortune, the government stands to collect about $1.9 million from other people charged as a result of Mueller's investigation.

Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw complex organized crime cases, said the leftover money, while substantial, represents ""icing on the cake for the government whose overriding priority is always a conviction.""
""Rarely is there money sufficient to make a big recovery,"" said Cotter, who is not a party to the Manafort case.  ""It's only when all the fighting is over involving the banks, family and every other creditor do your really know what the leftover assets are really worth.""
Among those picking at the multi-million-dollar leftovers: 
 Citizens Bank in New York has reached a deal with federal prosecutors for the possible recovery of up to $3.2 million in loans on a Soho apartment owned by Manafort, pending its sale by the government..
At Manafort's August trial on financial fraud charges, prosecutors offered evidence that he had falsified the loan application, including inflating his income by $1.5 million. A mortgage loan assistant at Citizens later testified that even as Manafort presented the application for the property listed as a second home, she found the same apartment listed for rent during an online search. (Manafort stood to obtain a better loan rate by classifying the property as a second home.)
 Under a separate agreement with the government, a property management firm linked to the same Soho property stands to collect more than $2,500 in in back condo fees, dating to last fall.
 The Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank, whose chief executive expedited approval of $16 million in loans for Manafort after he and the former Trump campaign chief discussed a possible role in the Trump administration, is seeking to claw back some of the loan's proceeds. Two of Manafort's New York properties, the Hampton compound and a $4.1 million Brooklyn brownstone, were offered as collateral for the loan package, which is now in serious default. The claim is pending.
Trump Tower in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, shown on March 16, 2016, has 58 floors of offices and condominiums, including 263 residential units.
 (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)
 The assistant secretary of the Trump Tower condo board asserted an interest in the anticipated sale of unit 43G, which once served as the Manaforts' stylish pied-a-terre in New York. The board, according to court documents, seeks an undisclosed amount in uncollected condo fees related to the property that once established Manafort and his wife as neighbors of the president. Separate property listings for the apartment show condo fees of about $2,000 per month. 
""Any sale of a residential unit in the condominium is conditioned on the claimant being paid all common charges due on a residential unit as of the date of conveyance,"" the board said in a court filing.
In court documents, prosecutors said they were in possible settlement discussions with the board, and that a resolution could be reached as soon as this week. 
 In one of the more obscure disputes, a federal judge has given a general contractor until March 8 to support his claim for $585,991.85 related to work on Manafort's Brooklyn brownstone.
Prosecutors have argued that the claim lacks ""standing"" and should be dismissed.
Manafort was found guilty of fraud and other charges by a federal court in Virginia, and pleaded guilty to related charges in another federal court in Washington. He hasn't been sentenced in either case, but has already agreed to give up a chunk of his fortune that he gained through illicit lobbying work for a pro-Russian faction in Ukraine. 
That fortune represent by far the bulk of fines and fees assessed against all targets in the Mueller inquiry so far.
Michael Cohen, the president's former personal attorney; Richard Gates, former Trump campaign deputy; Michael Flynn, former Trump national security adviser; George Papadopoulos, former campaign foreign policy adviser; and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch attorney whose firm was linked to Manaforts work, all have been either assessed fines and fees or face financial penalties related to their convictions in the Russia inquiry and related investigations.
 Exactly how the final balance sheet for Mueller's investigation will even out may not be fully known for months. Trump has used the investigation's price tag  albeit an inflated one  to disparage the inquiry as a ""witch hunt."" He falsely claimed that its costs had topped $40 million.
When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2018
David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who handled international drug trafficking and fraud cases, said it would be ""unusual"" indeed to hope than any investigation as complex as Mueller's could turn a profit.
In (most) fraud cases, while there may be forfeitures, most of that money first goes towards restitution, Weinstein said. In drug trafficking and money laundering cases, where there is no restitution and the government can actually recover the forfeited funds, those are cases where the government can hope to break even.

The one thing that never gets much press — the IRS shows the statistics for the top 400 people of the highest income and the rate they pay. Anyway, you should look at that. It’s about a 20 percent rate, so it has nothing to do with the 39.6 marginal ordinary income rate. So it’s a misfocus. If you focus on that, you’re missing the picture.""
Gates, who stepped down from leading the software giant in 2006 to focus on the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, added that there are politicians who are so extreme with their policy proposals, that they would start to create tax dodging and certain disincentives, while causing ""income to show up in other countries and things.""
The tech titan did concede that taxes ""can be more progressive,"" including issues such as the estate tax and the tax on capital, the way the FICA and Social Security operate. ""We can be more progressive without really threatening income generation — what you have left to decide how to spread around,"" Gates said.

During the podcast, Gates also weighed in on a number of ideas that Ocasio-Cortez and more progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have championed, including “modern monetary theory,” saying it is ""some crazy talk,” adding “It will come back and bite you.”
As described by the American Monetary Institute (AMI), a non-profit charity funded to describe monetary reforms for the average citizen, MMT ""shows a lack of respect for empirical facts"" and ""stretches and twists the meaning of words beyond normal usage.""
Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News.
Earlier this year, Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, said in an interview on ""60 Minutes"" that her Green New Deal could be paid for in part by slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on top earners.
“But once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""That doesn’t mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.”

 Multiple former Toys ""R"" Us executives are working for a new company called Tru Kids that's planning a comeback for the toy retailer, according to CNBC. Following Toys ""R"" Us' bankruptcy in 2018, some of its lenders took control of its brand names and other intellectual property, and Tru Kids now manages those brands. 
Business Insider Intelligence 
Tru Kids' plans for Toys ""R"" Us are still developing, and could see it open stand-alone stores, pop-up locations, or partnerships where Toys ""R"" Us' private labels and branding appear at other retailers, similar to what Toys ""R"" Us' lenders did at Kroger this past holiday season. 
 The comeback is focused in the US since Toys ""R"" Us still operates overseas, and Tru Kids is aiming to provide better technology and in-store experiences to try to avoid some of the troubles that led to Toys ""R"" Us' bankruptcy. 
 But Toys ""R"" Us will be returning to a different landscape with heightened competition since several retailers stepped up to try to take its place over the holidays. Retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and Target bolstered their toy offerings during the holidays in the hopes of capturing the market share left behind by Toys ""R"" Us. 
 So, Toys ""R"" Us will have to rebuild its image and consumer base while competing with powerful retailers that are more engaged in its industry. And because of Toys ""R"" Us' liquidation, those retailers now have stronger e-commerce capabilities and larger brick-and-mortar networks, making a successful comeback a difficult task. 
 If Tru Kids can rebuild Toys ""R"" Us, there's a valuable opportunity for it to succeed as a year-round toy retailer. 
 The major retailers that have upped their investment in toys aren't going to keep it up outside of the holiday season. The holidays are the most lucrative time for toy retailers, but Toys ""R"" Us still racked up nearly $6.5 billion in sales in the first three quarters of 2017, so there's plenty of value in the industry all year. And competitors that aren't exclusively toy retailers aren't committed to having huge inventories of toys year-round, potentially leaving consumers in a lurch. If Toys ""R"" Us returns as a full-time toy retailer and has a big enough reach, it may be able to reestablish itself outside of the holiday season, when there's less competition, which could drive holiday success too. 
 Toy manufacturers have seen their sales drop despite increased interest from other retailers, potentially making working with a reborn Toys ""R"" Us attractive. Manufacturers may be hesitant to work with Toys ""R"" Us after its bankruptcy, but with top players like Hasbro and Mattel seeing their sales drop in the all-important holiday quarter — 13% year-over-year (YoY) and 5% YoY, respectively — they might be more willing to give it a chance. And they may be particularly excited about a year-round retailer, as it would give them more opportunities to make sales, so Tru Kids would be wise to consider making a push beyond the holidays."

As more people look for love on dating apps and social media, there's a steady spike in scammers trying to warm their way into hearts and wallets.
Last year, consumers reported the most fraud losses from ""emotional romance scams"" than any other category of fraud, said Monica Vaca, of the Federal Trade Commission. ""That's $143 million that consumers reported that they lost in 2018 to romance scams.""
The median reported loss last year amounted to $2,600 seven times higher than other frauds, according to the FTC. Most of that money was wired or sent with gift cards.
Federal data also show that people between the ages of 40 to 69 have the highest rates of romance scams.
One woman told NBC News that she was swindled following her divorce.
Connie, who asked her real name not be used for fear of embarrassment, said she began looking for love on the online dating site Plenty of Fish.
""I met this guy and he was supposed to be a doctor and so he was very charming, he had the whole set up, pictures with the dog, his house on the beach,"" Connie said. ""And so we talked for about a week or two weeks.""
But what appeared to be a connection turned into a con. The man said he was taking a work trip abroad, and that's when his actions became suspicious: He began asking Connie for money.
""He said you can send me $100 on (an) Amazon card,"" she said.
Such requests for money, however, should be an immediate red flag, according to the FTC.
""You know as long as that spigot is on and there's a little bit of money coming through to these folks, they're going to keep trying to get some of that money,"" Vaca said.
Scammers often use similar tactics to pull at heartstrings. The FTC said creative tales of emergencies and misfortune requiring financial assistance are common. Any plans to meet in person, however, never transpire.
Further investigation typically reveals the swindler's profile is phony, the FTC said.
""When they take those photographs and they do a Google image search on those photographs, they'll find that photo, and they will see it with someone else's name,"" Vaca said.
Connie fell into that exact trap.
""I couldn't find him. I searched his Facebook and everything, and then I realized it was just a fake person, using somebody else's pictures and everything,"" she said. ""I was very upset because it was a waste of time and energy.""
Victims are encouraged to report online scams to FTC.gov.

Levien oversees advertising and circulation revenue, which has been the big growth story recently. The Times just hit 3.4 million digital subscriptions and 4.3 million total subs, including print, and set a goal of passing 10 million subscriptions by 2025. 
 But while President Trump (who has mocked the paper as the ""failing New York Times"") contributed heavily to the growth of the Times and other news outlets after the 2016 election, Levien said the Times is no longer reliant on the ""Trump bump,"" as other stories gain attention and it invests in stories no one else is doing. 
 ""At this point, the president is no longer driving our subs,"" Levien told Business Insider. ""We're still in a very strong news cycle. Investigations will continue to get a substantial amount of investment. That's the kind of work I don't think anyone is doing at scale."" 
 She also talked about getting people to pay at the higher end, the Times' relationship with distribution platforms, and why she's not worried about competitors heavily discounting subscriptions. 
Here's our conversation, edited and condensed:
Lucia Moses: The Times got a big subscription boost in part with a $1-per-week deal it's been running. Is there any concern that people will drop off once the promotion ends? 
Meredith Levien: We're about six months into that offer, and retention is pretty good. We don't publicize our retention rate, but it's gotten substantially better. We've had a number of people come in at 50% off who we had to step up to full price, and that went really well. We're getting better at how we onboard you and interact with you in the first 90 days. We're still not as good as the best subscription companies out there, but we're a lot better than we were, and that gives us confidence we should be able to retain at whatever offer we get people in at. As we get better at the product we're also making it more valuable. I don't think there are a lot of places in news where you can say that. 
Moses: Where does the Times need to get better? 
Levien: We have three big areas of investment. We added 120 new journalists in 2018 and we will continue do that. Investigations will continue to get a substantial amount of investment. Things like the story of Trump's family wealth and taxes. That's the kind of work I don't think anyone is doing at scale. Everything about how tech is transforming the world and we'll keep covering that. There's a presidential election and we'll continue to invest in how we cover politics. Climate remains a giant story and we see that as a really important area to put fresh investments.

 We're making big investments in the customer journey and user experience. From the moment someone hits a New York Times story on Facebook or Google, we're doing more to explain the access model. We're putting a lot of energy and thought into our app. That's not been an area we've been focused on. 
Moses: Trump has been a big subscription driver. How do you think about continuing growth once the Trump era ends? 
Levien: A couple things. We felt very confident in the second half of the year and at this point that the president is no longer driving our subscriptions. We're still in a very strong news cycle. Tech, climate change — these are really big stories that are getting a lot of attention. So we feel pretty confident that as we invest in politics and stories beyond politics, we'll see meaningful engagement at the Times. 
Moses: Why did the Times set a goal of subscriptions rather than subscription revenue? 
Levien: The first goal was to double digital revenue in five years. We're well ahead of that. We're a $1.7 billion public company, and we need to grow revenue and need a certain amount of profitability to invest in the business. So implied in the 10 million is we will do that in a way that will make the Times a healthy and successful company. 
Moses: How does it impact the Times' ability to charge with more publishers getting into online subscriptions and often heavily discounting? 
Levien: We are making a market for subscription journalism and you don't make a market by yourself, so it's really, really good that there are many, many getting into the space. A healthy, ascendant Washington Post, a strong Wall Street Journal are good for a healthy, ascendant New York Times. That said, how do we think about others discounting more aggressively? I think what we do is fundamentally different and worth paying more for. We've been much more aggressive with brand marketing than anyone who be considered a close competitor. So I'm not terribly worried about where anyone else prices their subscriptions. The Post has done extraordinary reporting on politics, The Wall Street Journal has done extraordinary reporting on business, but I don't think there's anyone other than The New York Times that pursues the truth and does our breadth of work. I'm not sure we have a peer. 
Moses: You've begun dynamic pricing of subscriptions. Do you see a point where you have people paying at all kinds of levels? 
Levien: We really see room on both sides of the demand curve. We've been testing the lower half. That's worked and reached an audience for whom the price before felt too high. At same time I think there's a large number of people who would pay whole lot and will pay a whole lot for The New York Times. All-digital access is $125. We have a lot of people who take that. We have people paying over $1,000 a year for The New York Times. I think there are probably people in the world who would pay $100,000 for a subscription because they believe so much in it. It's a business challenge to identify people who would pay a lot and get it to them in a way that makes sense. We're putting lot of thought into how to get at the high end of the demand curve. We'll test higher prices. We'll put out more product. We keep putting more value in the paper. 
Moses: What's working on platforms and where is there room for improvement? 
Levien: We continue to have productive relationships, with some more than others. We've spent lot of money with Facebook, Google, Twitter, building our audience with subscribers. All of that said, we're most focused on The New York Times as the best place to experience journalism. On Google, we like what they're doing, the tool set they built with Subscribe with Google. 
Moses: And Facebook and Apple News, which have or are working on subscription products? 
Levien: I don't think we'll comment on that. We are at the moment most focused on our own model and user experience. I don't think we've talked publicly about whether we'll participate in [Apple News subscription service] Texture. Apple News, like Google and Facebook and to some degree Twitter, continue to be one of a handful of important sources of people discovering a story first from the Times. 
Moses: How do you assess the digital news landscape now, which has been dominated by a lot of layoff stories? 
Levien: It's really unfortunate and upsetting that we're losing so many jobs in journalism. I think that is not good for the world. What is going well is: journalism is finding its way into new places in people's lives. As we find ways to get into stories and find new formats like audio where we can do news in a more narrative, interesting way, I think there's an opportunity for high-quality journalism to play a bigger role in people's lives. 
 The Daily is a success for so many reasons but it really invented this new form of narrative news. The format is intimate. The special sauce wasn't just the story but understanding how the story came to be and the story behind the story. It gives people a sense of how we do the work we do. We'll keep making The Daily bigger and we're very focused on what other shows and special events we can launch through it. Caliphate was one example. We'll do multi-episode specials and grow shows out of audio."

More than 40 percent of people said they'd be most likely to take investing advice from the Oracle of Omaha, according to the Acorns 2018 Money Matters Report.
The famous investor who knocked on doors selling chewing gum as a child is now worth $83.6 billion.
Meanwhile, 32 percent of those polled thought Oprah Winfrey is the best choice to discuss their finances. Just 17 percent think President Donald Trump should be their go-to guy.
And despite their success, just 5 percent of people want financial wisdom from Jay-Z or Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook.
So what is Buffett's advice? ""[I]n 10 or 20 or 30 years, I think stocks will be a lot higher than they are now,"" Buffett has said. ""If you buy them over time, you basically can't lose.""
Still, many Americans are delaying investing until their financial situation improves, the Acorns report found
""There's a sense that this is too big a mountain to climb,"" said Noah Kerner, CEO of Acorns.
Half of respondents didn't invest any money in 2018, while 80 percent of those who did put less than $5,000 in the market.

 The 57 Mbps slower download speeds show there's some sort of bottlenecking between the primary router in the living room and the Beacon satellite unit upstairs in the bedroom. That's despite the strong connection between the router and the Beacon satellite, according to the Eero app. 
 Still, 137 Mbps download speeds are pretty great. That'll easily handle pretty much any streaming or internet activity you throw at it, including 4K streaming. In fact, 137 Mbps is enough for five people to stream 4K videos from Netflix at the same time, all from the single Beacon satellite unit upstairs. For reference, Netflix recommends at last 25 Mbps for 4K streaming. 
 Also, you should consider that my internet speeds are way-above-average, as I've signed up for a speedy internet service from my internet service provider (ISP). If you have a more modest 50 Mbps internet plan from your ISP, you would likely get full speeds from the Beacon satellite. That's because the Beacon satellite units appear to reach a limit of around 140 Mbps, and it could easily handle a 50 Mbps connection. 
 The MacBook Pro I'm using for testing also switched over from the router downstairs to the Beacon satellite upstairs fairly quickly, too. No manual switching here."

Ocasio-Cortez has pushed raising the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent on income over $10 million. The top marginal rate is currently 37 percent. But Microsoft founder Gates, without mentioning Ocasio-Cortez by name, said this kind of approach is ""a misfocus. If you focus on that, you're missing the picture.""

""In terms of revenue collection, you wouldn't want to just focus on the ordinary income rate, because people who are wealthy have a rounding error of ordinary income,"" Gates, one of the richest people in the world, told The Verge in a new interview. ""They have income that just is the value of their stock, which if they don't sell it, it doesn't show up as income at all, or if it shows up, it shows over in the capital gains side. So the ability of hedge fund people, various people they aren't paying that ordinary income rate.""
Instead, he said lawmakers should focus on things like the estate tax, taxes on capital and Social Security. His view may be more closely aligned with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposed tax policy that focuses on taxing net worth on households worth more than $50 million.
""Now, you finally have some politicians who are so extreme that I'd say, 'No, that's even beyond.' You do start to create tax dodging and disincentives, and an incentive to have the income show up in other countries and things,"" Gates said, an apparent reference to Ocasio-Cortez. ""We can be more progressive without really threatening income generation what you have left to decide how to spread around.""
Gates, who held the title of the richest man on Earth on and off for decades before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unseated him last year, also ripped the increasingly popular modern monetary theory. 
The school of thought has received backing on the left from politicians such as Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow Democratic-socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is likely to run for president in 2020. President Donald Trump has expressed views that align with it, too. ""First of all, you never have to default because you print the money. I hate to tell you.

Either its a great price on a terrible product or a not-so-great deal on an amazing product. That's why we use lab testing and price checking tools to make sure you're actually getting a good deal.

As most coffee snobs will tell you, the best tasting cup of coffee comes from a French press. They may require a bit more work, but they really produce one of the smoothest cups of coffee you'll ever have. This one from Bodum is one of the best French presses we've ever tested. We found that it worked well, but it should be noted that there's no cover in front of the pouring spout, so coffee can lose heat pretty quickly. Right now, you can get it for just $10.

 Amazon is launching a live-streaming video version of a home shopping network called ""Amazon Live,"" according to TechCrunch. 
Business Insider intelligence 
The new live-streaming offering will feature live video shows hosted by Amazon talent as well as by individual brands, which will be able to broadcast their own shows live via a new app called Amazon Live Creator, launching as part of the initiative. The shows will talk viewers through products for sale on Amazon, which will be shown in a carousel underneath the video streams. 
 Amazon Live highlights how the tech giant is expanding the integration of e-commerce and digital video on its platform. Although Amazon is first and foremost an e-commerce platform, it's likewise a powerful streaming video provider. 
 With its legacy e-commerce business and its growing focus on original programming for Prime Video, Amazon is strongly positioned to drive purchases on the back of digital video content. This isn't the first time Amazon has tried selling products through video on its platform. In 2016, Amazon launched ""Style Code Live,"" which ran live on the platform on weekday evenings, though was canceled after 15 months. 
 With its newest announcement, the e-tailer has merchandising efforts in the works across three different types of digital video - live-streaming, unscripted reality, and scripted shows. In addition to Amazon Live, Amazon is also reportedly developing a shoppable competitive fashion reality series that will be hosted by fashion gurus Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn of TV's ""Project Runway,"" though that show is expected to be exclusive to Prime members, while Amazon Live shows are available to anyone who visits the site or app. The e-tailer is also reportedly working on a scripted series with A-list actress Blake Lively that will feature a merchandising element. 
 Brands that partner with Amazon on the new live-streaming venture stand to boost discoverability, customer acquisition, and conversions all in one fell swoop. Brands will not only find central placement in front of Prime's global membership of 100 million subscribers in more than 200 countries, but will be accessible to non-members as well. 
 Further, because video content is viewed on the e-commerce platform itself, Amazon creates a more streamlined path to purchase directly from the point of engagement with content. Amazon has an increasingly central role in the consumer online purchase journey: Almost 90% of Amazon's product views come from the platform's own product search, rather than advertising, merchandising, or product aggregators, per Jumpshot."

David Lohr was arrested on Wednesday in Santa Clara when he allegedly terrified passengers on a bus by spreading white powder and hydrogen peroxide all over it. It was later revealed that he was wanted by the FBI for a string of incidents involving food tampering at various Safeway grocery stores and Targets in California and Arizona.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Lohr allegedly poured bleach into several supermarket freezers, which contained dairy products, frozen seafood, ice and alcohol, in the neighborhoods of Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, West Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Sunnyvale.
CALIFORNIA MAN ACCUSED OF STABBING PERSON AT MOTEL SEEN SMILING IN MUGSHOT
After being apprehended in Santa Clara following the bus incident last week, deputies found that the substance he was spreading was salt. Although Lohr left the scene, they later discovered him at a different bus stop with receipts from Safeway stores stuffed in his pockets. Upon further investigation, employees at a nearby Safeway told police they discovered an empty hydrogen peroxide bottle in a rotisserie chicken tray late last month. Surveillance footage reportedly showed Lohr pouring bleach over a carton of eggs at the same store.
Authorities are trying to determine if the tainted products were sold to any customers.
“To date, there have been no known reports of individuals sickened by Lohr’s actions; however, further investigation has determined that Lohr has done this in a variety of stores, and the extent of his actions are currently under investigation,” FBI officials said.
Lohr's bizarre crimes were first realized last October in Phoenix, when he was arrested for bleaching products at six Target stores. While in jail for those offenses, Lohr reportedly spoke with Fox 10, telling them that he poured bleach on the products at Target in an attempt to clean the chemicals off of them.
“I did nothing wrong,” Lohr told Fox 10. “I committed no crime. Absolutely no crime.”

After being released from police custody, he failed to appear in court for the alleged Phoenix incidents, and has been considered a fugitive since then.
Records show that Lohr is no stranger to law enforcement. He was reportedly arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor assault in Portland, Oregon in 2012, and spent a month in jail for grand larceny in Florida in 2009."

 Let's face it — some foundation applicators eat product, causing you to use way more than strictly necessary in order to cover your face. The Sigma Beauty Flat Kabuki Makeup Brush F80 doesn't absorb any product, thanks to bristles made of the brand's proprietary Sigmax fibers. 
 A little foundation goes a very long way, so you may need to get used to applying less than usual when using this brush. But that's definitely not a bad thing, because it has the potential to save you a lot of money in the long term. This flat-top structure is ideal for liquid formulations as opposed to powders. 
 The Sigmax fibers are hypoallergenic and antibacterial, so they'll reduce the chance of breakouts between washes, and they're durable, resistant to both heat and various chemicals. 
Sigma Beauty Flat Kabuki Makeup Brush F80 has a ton of reviews online. It won an Allure Best of Beauty Award in 2016 and is an Amazon's Choice item with more than 2,000 customer responses and a 4.2-star rating. The brush has also been featured by Rank and Style. 
 ""I legit only use half the amount of pumps of foundation using this brush compared to using a beauty blender (which btw just soaks up everything, great blender but uses too much product),"" writes one reviewer. Another shopper says she even uses it for non-streaky sunless tanner application. 
Pros: Doesn't absorb product so you use less, hypoallergenic, antibacterial, durable, heat-resistant 
Cons: Only works for liquid or cream, not powder"

r…",https://www.businessinsider.com/shawn-layden-interview-sony-playstation-4-success-2019-2,business-insider,2019-02-12 15:55:00,The PlayStation 4 has dominated the current video game cycle over the past five years  and exclusive games like Marvels SpiderMan Uncharted 4 and God of War are a big reason for that  The numbers highlight the importance of exclusives Five of the top 10 bestselling PlayStation 4 games of alltime cant be played on any other console and 13 of the 28 PlayStation 4 games that made more than 1 million in sales  about half  are also PS4 exclusives  Its not just sales On Metacritic which aggregates reviews from different publications six of the top 10 bestreviewed PS4 games are exclusives and roughly onethird of the PS4 games with a Metacritic score of at least 90 are exclusives as well  Not every exclusive PS4 title has been a megasmash hit and some releases feel directed towards different audiences But theres an underlying quality where each production while extremely different in tone and style has a consistent level of polish  We have to lead from the front said Shawn Layden chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios Karen AubyPlayStation Layden 57 has been with Sony PlayStation for more than 30 years He understands Sonys global footprint better than anyone  The Notre Dame grad started working for Sony in Tokyo not the US in its corporate communications department under the the late Sony cofounder Akio Morita He eventually moved to the UK to manage software development at the companys London Studio and shortly afterwards he became VP of Sony Computer Entertainments SCE Europe division  After nine years in Europe Layden returned to Tokyo to serve as president of SCE Japan and in 2010 he was named chief operating officer and executive vice president at Sony Network Entertainment International SNEI  In 2014 Laydens international work paid off back in the states He was named president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America succeeding veteran Jack Tretton and becoming the official face of PlayStation at all of the companys big press events including E3 the annual gaming expo in Los Angeles Then last year in a corporate reorganization Layden was named chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment SIE Worldwide Studios  Now Layden is charged with managing the dozenplus studios around the world that develop exclusive games for PlayStation consoles Layden is routinely emailing calling and visiting these studios in person to talk with employees check in on the status of upcoming games and ensure the companies are reaching their goals which Layden calls milestones or checkin points  Layden says managing the 13 game studios around the world under the SIE umbrella  seven in the United States three in Europe and two in Japan  is like managing different personalities  We are an entertainment business which means the folks involved in creating the content are artists Layden told Business Insider I believe that to be true  On a recent phone call Layden offered insight into his work schedule how he copes with so much travel and how Sonys global approach and focus on quality has been key to the PlayStation 4s success This interview has been lightly edited for clarityDave Smith How important is it for you to have studios all around the world instead of just focusing on one region like the US Shawn Layden We have a pretty broad tent with studios throughout the US and Europe and Asia I think one of the interesting unique features that we can claim from Worldwide Studios here at PlayStation is that we have the ability to create  and have shown the ability to create  tripleA content in three different regions Sony Interactive Entertainment America CEO Shawn Layden Christian PetersenGetty Images PlayStation was always intended to be a global platform When we brought out the PlayStation back in 1994 we came out of Japan but quickly moved to establish businesses in Europe and America  So together with that the role of Worldwide Studios has been to not dominate the gaming market not take the largest market share or dominant share of that but to bring content to the platform which really makes the hardware sing  To be truly a good platform we have to be able to deliver at that quality bar content that appeals to our European fans our Japanese fans and our American fans Smith Id love to know about how you control the quality and consistency across so many games that are exclusive to the console SIE Worldwide must be a huge part of that Layden Its our mandate You know we talk about this inside the studios the rubric of first best and must The content we make has to fulfill one of those three rubrics  When we come out with a racing game were gonna come out with the best racing game in the world  Gran Turismo When we lean into action adventure were gonna give you Uncharted or God of War or Horizon Zero Dawn  games like that  Since we only code to one platform we really want to be the leader in showing everything that platform can deliver We dont have to make choices to create technologies which will run across many different target technologies We just lean into the PlayStation thing solely And it allows us to focus our attentions there Horizon Zero Dawn Guerrilla Games The working week Smith What is a typical day like for you Layden I think my typical day typically involves the airport laughs Lets just do this from the assumption that Im in California which is not a bad assumption but its certainly not the majority of my time  Like most people the first thing you do when you get up in the morning is you reach for your phone and you know see what has blown up somewhere In the morning I can talk to Europe Quite often Im touching base with a studio or leadership in our European studios  Throughout the day its like so many business really email driven I spend a lot of time on the phone And then in the evening thats the time when I can get in touch with our Japanese studios and Japanese leadership So it goes from early in the morning to late in the evening kind of cycle I dont think thats any different from anybody else in this business Karen AubyPlayStation Smith What are the biggest challenges you face at work on a daytoday basis Layden I find the biggest challenge of my job is that were such a distributed entity as far as Worldwide Studios go  We have studios scattered across the Pacific Northwest and California spine of the country And our studios in Japan and Europe  So what I really try to do is to get around the world as much as I can Because everything you can get from a WebEx teleconference or an email but at its heart game production is a creative activity And as a creative activity it really comes down to the people behind the project  To really understand what their challenges are or what their ambitions are and hopes are youre going to have to get there in person and and speak to them about it Smith It seems like youre on the road a lot How do you cope with so much travel Any good tips AmazonLayden I was very very late to the party But one of the greatest things about traveling is I finally bought a Kindle The Paperwhite Its awesome I dont know how they managed to get a battery that lasts four weeks but its a great piece of technology and it has helped my carryon luggage slim down from carrying hard books  I still carry a Vita from time to time but my Vita is a dedicated Everybodys Golf machine That remains my favorite pickupandplay game I think its just the nature of it you know You can play a hole and pause and come back to it later Its very dip in dip out  But traveling is all about reducing your carry weight And so Kindle was a great move for me  Why Sony is skipping E3 Smith It sounds like youre spending a lot of time with each studio But when you talk to them what are the sorts of things you discuss Layden Well I have a powerful partner in managing the studios  you know the man the myth the legend Shuhei Yoshida who is president of our Worldwide Studios And with him in the presidents seat and me in the chairman seat that gives us really good management coverage and visibility on the studio activities  Shu is as much or even more peripatetic than I am that guys on the road all the time He also believes the only way to really understand the daytoday of the game development process is to really be there be in the studios be with the teams and speak with them  So Shu and I have very close contact on a weekly basis to discuss whats up with him whats up with me and where were going with the teams And then we have regular cadence amongst the leadership of Worldwide Studios that fits on a monthly basis And then we try to get them out in the world  I try to see every studio at least quarterly But things like GDC or DICE or GamesCom those kind of events actually brings us all together in the same space and we always take advantage of those opportunities to huddle up and talk about the future Andrew House president and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Reuters Smith Speaking of those opportunities you guys are not doing E3 this year for the first time Is this the future of Sony to hold your own events and invite your developers into the fold that way How do you plan on keeping tabs on everyone without E3 Layden I think if you look at the industry over time with E3 we were an original founder of that event through our association with ESA and the other industry partners 25 years ago But it was a much different world then  I remember going to the first E3 and the only guests we had there were from retail Youd come across people who would say things like Hi Im the Sears buyer and Im in charge of Barbie Hot Wheels VHS and video games Can you tell me about your industry So it was a real education process talking with a guy from Sears and explain to him what PlayStation 1 was all about  Fast forward to today and our buying partners are Best Buy or Target or GameStop I mean they are as up to speed or in some areas more up to speed on the entire industry than we are Theyre plugged in 247 all year long So the idea of coming together on a day in June to learn about the industry that role for a trade show has kind of evaporated  We took the decision not to attend E3 this year because we wanna make sure that when we do come together at some point bring all our fans in under the invitation that PlayStation has something marvelous to share with you we wanna make sure that we do And E3 this year just wasnt the right time for us  The importance of deadlines Smith I want to talk about management style for a bit Do you feel like your approach with the studios is more hands on or hands off How important are deadlines to you Layden You know weve been at this for over 25 years now And I think we are understanding better the power of unleashing the creative  and really being able to speak with individuals or with teams that have a vision for a game they wanna bring forward  Having done it so often over so many years I think were just getting better at it Were more experienced at it We understand what the real cost time and money for a great scope is and prepare ourselves to deliver that  Deadlines are important but theyre not an end unto themselves Deadlines or milestones are ways that you measure your progress across a trajectory Theyre checkin points Are we achieving this level of artistic quality If the story works what are the beats Are the animations executed And more often than not if we feel that we need to spend a little more time in any one of those categories weve made provisions and were prepared to move a date if its in service of achieving a greater result  And I know in the game community people are disappointed to find out that Hey What do you mean youre moving it up 30 days or 60 days or 90 days But once weve come to market everyone says Oh my God Im so glad you did laughs Because we can only answer that disappointment by delivering an awesome result Smith Do you find that you manage each company a little differently Do you find that each company has its own kind of personality Layden Oh absolutely I mean we are an entertainment business which means that the folks involved in creating the content are artists I believe that to be true And when youre working with artists and the creative process sure its different every place you go MLB The Show 18 Sony Interactive Entertainment We have a team in San Diego that makes the worlds best baseball game and I would argue the worlds best sports game  MLB The Show But they have to deliver every year by opening day If you think about it thats an incredible business cycle  Others in the gaming community deliver sports titles annually as well so theyll understand the challenge of that but to deliver that consistently at a quality bar which is amazing and keep your fans happy They effectively work a 10month development cycle  Then you have other teams like Media Molecule who have spent the last four or five years working on the Dreams technology which weve just looked at the data a few weeks ago and people are blown away by the power of that platform  to put games creativity into the hands of fans  And every other studio is as different as those two examples Ive just given So yes Studios

all supporting and leading an entertainment revolution of gaming You know all hands to the till Were all in this together,"The PlayStation 4 has dominated the current video game cycle over the past five years — and exclusive games like ""Marvel's Spider-Man,"" ""Uncharted 4,"" and ""God of War"" are a big reason for that. 
 The numbers highlight the importance of exclusives: Five of the top 10 best-selling PlayStation 4 games of all-time can't be played on any other console, and 13 of the 28 PlayStation 4 games that made more than $1 million in sales — about half — are also PS4 exclusives. 
 It's not just sales. On Metacritic, which aggregates reviews from different publications, six of the top 10 best-reviewed PS4 games are exclusives, and roughly one-third of the PS4 games with a Metacritic score of at least 90 are exclusives as well. 
 Not every exclusive PS4 title has been a mega-smash hit, and some releases feel directed towards different audiences. But there's an underlying quality where each production, while extremely different in tone and style, has a consistent level of polish. 
 ""We have to lead from the front,"" said Shawn Layden, chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios. 
Karen Auby/PlayStation 
Layden, 57, has been with Sony PlayStation for more than 30 years. He understands Sony's global footprint better than anyone. 
 The Notre Dame grad started working for Sony in Tokyo, not the US, in its corporate communications department under the the late Sony cofounder Akio Morita. He eventually moved to the UK to manage software development at the company's London Studio, and shortly afterwards he became VP of Sony Computer Entertainment's (SCE) Europe division. 
 After nine years in Europe, Layden returned to Tokyo to serve as president of SCE Japan, and in 2010, he was named chief operating officer and executive vice president at Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI). 
 In 2014, Layden's international work paid off back in the states: He was named president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, succeeding veteran Jack Tretton and becoming the official face of PlayStation at all of the company's big press events, including E3, the annual gaming expo in Los Angeles. Then last year, in a corporate reorganization, Layden was named chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) Worldwide Studios. 
 Now, Layden is charged with managing the dozen-plus studios around the world that develop exclusive games for PlayStation consoles. Layden is routinely emailing, calling, and visiting these studios in person to talk with employees, check in on the status of upcoming games, and ensure the companies are reaching their goals, which Layden calls ""milestones"" or ""check-in points."" 
 Layden says managing the 13 game studios around the world under the SIE umbrella — seven in the United States, three in Europe, and two in Japan — is like managing different personalities. 
 ""We are an entertainment business, which means the folks involved in creating the content are artists,"" Layden told Business Insider. ""I believe that to be true."" 
 On a recent phone call, Layden offered insight into his work schedule, how he copes with so much travel, and how Sony's global approach, and focus on quality, has been key to the PlayStation 4's success. 
This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
Dave Smith: How important is it for you to have studios all around the world, instead of just focusing on one region like the US? 
Shawn Layden: We have a pretty broad tent with studios throughout the US, and Europe, and Asia. I think one of the interesting, unique features that we can claim from Worldwide Studios here at PlayStation is that we have the ability to create — and have shown the ability to create — triple-A content in three different regions. 
Sony Interactive Entertainment America CEO Shawn Layden

PlayStation was always intended to be a global platform. When we brought out the PlayStation back in 1994, we came out of Japan, but quickly moved to establish businesses in Europe and America. 
 So together with that, the role of Worldwide Studios has been to not dominate the gaming market, not take the largest market share or dominant share of that, but to bring content to the platform, which really makes the hardware sing. 
 To be truly a good platform, we have to be able to deliver, at that quality bar, content that appeals to our European fans, our Japanese fans, and our American fans. 
Smith: I'd love to know about how you control the quality and consistency across so many games that are exclusive to the console. SIE Worldwide must be a huge part of that. 
Layden: It's our mandate. You know, we talk about this inside the studios: the rubric of 'first,' 'best' and 'must;' The content we make has to fulfill one of those three rubrics. 
 When we come out with a racing game, we're gonna come out with the best racing game in the world — ""Gran Turismo."" When we lean into action adventure, we're gonna give you ""Uncharted,"" or ""God of War,"" or ""Horizon [Zero Dawn]"" — games like that. 
 Since we only code to one platform, we really want to be the leader in showing everything that platform can deliver. We don't have to make choices to create technologies which will run across many different target technologies. We just lean into the PlayStation thing solely. And it allows us to focus our attentions there. 
""Horizon Zero Dawn""
 Guerrilla Games 
The working week 
Smith: What is a typical day like for you? 
Layden: I think my typical day, typically involves the airport. (laughs) Let's just do this from the assumption that I'm in California, which is not a bad assumption, but it's certainly not the majority [of my time]. 
 Like most people, the first thing you do when you get up in the morning is you reach for your phone and, you know, see what has blown up somewhere. In the morning, I can talk to Europe. Quite often I'm touching base with a studio or leadership in our European studios. 
 Throughout the day it's, like so many business, really email driven. I spend a lot of time on the phone. And then in the evening, that's the time when I can get in touch with our Japanese studios, and Japanese leadership. So it goes from early in the morning to late in the evening kind of cycle. I don't think that's any different from anybody else in this business. 
Karen Auby/PlayStation 
Smith: What are the biggest challenges you face at work on a day-to-day basis? 
Layden: I find the biggest challenge of my job is that we're such a distributed entity, as far as Worldwide Studios go. 
 We have studios scattered across the Pacific Northwest and California spine of the country. And our studios in Japan and Europe. 
 So, what I really try to do is to get around the world as much as I can. Because everything you can get from a WebEx [teleconference], or an email, but at its heart, game production is a creative activity. And as a creative activity, it really comes down to the people behind the project. 
 To really understand what their challenges are, or what their ambitions are and hopes are, you're going to have to get there in person and, and speak to them about it. 
Smith: It seems like you're on the road a lot. How do you cope with so much travel? Any good tips? 
Amazon
Layden: I was very, very late to the party. But one of the greatest things about traveling is I finally bought a Kindle. The Paperwhite. It's awesome. I don't know how they managed to get a battery that lasts four weeks, but it's a great piece of technology, and it has helped my carry-on luggage slim down, from carrying hard books. 
 I still carry a Vita from time to time, but my Vita is a dedicated ""Everybody's Golf"" machine. That remains my favorite pick-up-and-play game. I think it's just the nature of it, you know. You can play a hole, and pause, and come back to it later. It's very dip in, dip out. 
 But traveling is all about reducing your carry weight. And so Kindle was a great move for me. 
 Why Sony is skipping E3 
Smith: It sounds like you're spending a lot of time with each studio. But when you talk to them, what are the sorts of things you discuss? 
Layden: Well, I have a powerful partner in managing the studios — you know, the man, the myth, the legend, Shuhei Yoshida, who is president of our Worldwide Studios. And with him in the president's seat, and me in the chairman seat, that gives us really good management coverage and visibility on the studio activities. 
 Shu is as much or even more peripatetic than I am; that guy's on the road all the time. He also believes the only way to really understand the day-to-day of the game development process is to really be there, be in the studios, be with the teams, and speak with them. 
 So Shu and I have very close contact on a weekly basis to discuss what's up with him, what's up with me, and where we're going with the teams. And then we have regular cadence amongst the leadership of Worldwide Studios that fits on a monthly basis. And then we try to get them out in the world. 
 I try to see every studio at least quarterly. But things like GDC, or D.I.C.E., or GamesCom, those kind of events, actually brings us all together in the same space, and we always take advantage of those opportunities to huddle up and talk about the future. 
Andrew House, president and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment
 Reuters 
Smith: Speaking of those opportunities, you guys are not doing E3 this year, for the first time. Is this the future of Sony, to hold your own events and invite your developers into the fold that way? How do you plan on keeping tabs on everyone without E3? 
Layden: I think if you look at the industry over time, with E3, we were an original founder of that event through our association with ESA, and the other industry partners, 25 years ago. But it was a much different world then. 
 I remember going to the first E3, and the only guests we had there were from retail. You'd come across people who would say things like, ""Hi, I'm the Sears buyer, and I'm in charge of Barbie, Hot Wheels, VHS, and video games. Can you tell me about your industry?"" So it was a real education process, talking with a guy from Sears, and explain to him what PlayStation 1 was all about. 
 Fast forward to today, and our buying partners are Best Buy, or Target, or GameStop. I mean, they are as up to speed, or in some areas, more up to speed on the entire industry than we are. They're plugged in 24/7, all year long. So the idea of coming together on a day in June to learn about the industry, that role for a trade show has kind of evaporated. 
 We took the decision not to attend E3 this year, because we wanna make sure that when we do come together at some point, bring all our fans in under the invitation that PlayStation has something marvelous to share with you, we wanna make sure that we do. And E3 this year just wasn't the right time for us. 
 The importance of deadlines 
Smith: I want to talk about management style for a bit. Do you feel like your approach with the studios is more hands on or hands off? How important are deadlines to you? 
Layden: You know, we've been at this for over 25 years now. And I think we are understanding better the power of unleashing the creative — and really being able to speak with individuals, or with teams, that have a vision for a game they wanna bring forward. 
 Having done it so often over so many years, I think we're just getting better at it. We're more experienced at it. We understand what the real cost, time and money, for a great scope is, and prepare ourselves to deliver that. 
 Deadlines are important, but they're not an end unto themselves. Deadlines, or milestones, are ways that you measure your progress across a trajectory. They're check-in points. Are we achieving this level of artistic quality? If the story works, what are the beats? Are the animations executed? And more often than not, if we feel that we need to spend a little more time in any one of those categories, we've made provisions, and we're prepared to move a date if it's in service of achieving a greater result. 
 And I know in the game community, people are disappointed to find out that, ""Hey! What do you mean you're moving it up 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days?"" But once we've come to market, everyone says, ""Oh my God, I'm so glad you did."" (laughs) Because we can only answer that disappointment by delivering an awesome result. 
Smith: Do you find that you manage each company a little differently? Do you find that each company has its own kind of personality? 
Layden: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we are an entertainment business, which means that the folks involved in creating the content are artists. I believe that to be true. And when you're working with artists, and the creative process, sure, it's different every place you go. 
""MLB: The Show 18""
 Sony Interactive Entertainment 
We have a team in San Diego that makes the world's best baseball game, and I would argue the world's best sports game — ""MLB: The Show."" But they have to deliver every year by opening day. If you think about it, that's an incredible business cycle. 
 Others in the gaming community deliver sports titles annually as well, so they'll understand the challenge of that, but to deliver that consistently at a quality bar, which is amazing, and keep your fans happy. They effectively work a 10-month development cycle. 
 Then you have other teams, like Media Molecule, who have spent the last four or five years working on the Dreams technology, which we've just looked at the data a few weeks ago, and people are blown away by the power of that platform — to put games creativity into the hands of fans. 
 And every other studio is as different as those two examples I've just given. So yes: Studios develop very differently, but we're all committed to one thing, which is we will bring the best experiences on the PlayStation platform, better than anybody else. We have to do that. We have to lead from the front. 
 What Sony doesn't do 
Smith: The PlayStation 4 has been a huge success, but do you find there's anything over this past cycle that you think PlayStation whiffed on? Was there anything you thought you guys could have done better, or just didn't do it at all — and want to do better on the next cycle? 
Layden: For all of the advances we've made, and the high bar we've focused on in storytelling. I mean, I dare anybody to experience something like ""The Last of Us"" and not feel emotional about it; and with ""God of War,"" that story of a father and son; and ""Horizon [Zero Dawn],"" and the power of Aloy, the protagonist. 
 All of these things, I believe we've done quite well. I'm very happy with the ""Spider-Man"" game that went out last year. And looking forward, ""Days Gone"" is coming in a couple months. That's not only compelling and gripping, but it will emotionally try you very hard. I think all those things we do really well. 
 What we don't do so much in is multiplayer. 
Smith: Do you mean local multiplayer, where two people can play in the same room next to each other, or online multiplayer games? 
Layden: Couch co-op — I mean that's a whole category I think the industry needs to look back at. We have that with sports titles, and some racing titles, but not with much else. And I think that speaks to the power of the internet on the one hand, but otherwise we might wanna revisit that to get more family engagement in the gaming experience. 
 But, no, I was referencing more with the things like ""GTA 5 Online,"" or you look at ""Call of Duty,"" or ""Fortnite,"" or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we've been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things, I think. That's an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term. 
""Fortnite""/Epic Games 
No competition 
Smith: Before we go, I wanted to ask you about the competition. How do you feel about your direct competitors? Is there anything you like about the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One? 
Layden: I don't know if you got a chance to see Geoff Keighley at the Game Awards last December, but it caused a bit of a ruckus when the industry saw [Nintendo of America president] Reggie [Fils-Aimé], [Xbox boss] Phil [Spencer] and myself standing on stage at the introduction of the event. 
 You know, we all have our Twitter feeds, and we all see the traffic that goes through there, and it seemed to create a bit of commotion. And I was struck by that thinking. People act like it's the first time the three of us have ever gotten together. 
 We all serve on the board of the Entertainment Software Association, the ESA. You'll see us all together at events where we celebrate movements of the gaming industry, and just last year we got to award Laila Shabir, the founder of Girls Make Games, for the wonderful things she's doing, for bringing young women into the gaming sector and learning about how that works. 
YouTube/TheGameAwards 
Reggie and Phil and I, we all have a lot of time for those outreach activities. And we work pretty well together. So, you know, I'm hoping that we've changed the conversation from ""competing platforms"" or, you know, which console won the holiday, or which platform won E3, and just look at what we're all bringing to the video game industry from our different perspectives. 
 I think Nintendo's doing wonderful things with Switch, and the platform. And it's sort of blurring the lines between what's at home gaming, what's on-the-go gaming. 
 But also I think Xbox has really raced with us on how we're pushing the bar out on technology and quality. And what they've done recently with their introduction of an adaptive controller, to increase accessibility in gaming, is a wonderful innovation. I hope to see more across the industry in support of that. We've been working with accessibility issues quite heavily for quite some time, particularly with Naughty Dog Studios and what they've done with giving gamers a variety of settings changes you can put into their games, depending on what your particular abilities are. 
 So I think as an industry, we all move forward. And, I for one, am gonna stop talking about using phrases like competitive platform, because I think we're all supporting and leading an entertainment revolution of gaming. You know, all hands to the till. We're all in this together."

I looked at the user terms for Google Wifi, a competing service, to see what Google uses the data for. It doesn't track websites or what you do online. Instead, it gathers data ""such as Wi-Fi channel, signal strength, and device types that are relevant to optimize your WiFi performance."" And it knows if you're using Google products like Google search or Gmail.
If Amazon collects device type information the way Google does, it could theoretically know all of the devices that connect to the internet in your home. It would know you have two iPhones, three iPads, a Fire TV and two Amazon Echos. As appliances get internet connections, too, it would know you have a washer, a dryer, and a fridge connected to the internet. Amazon and its partners are already building products like smart microwaves that know when you run out of food so they can order more.
The more Amazon knows about what people already own, the more efficient it can be at suggesting and selling products through Amazon.com -- which is still the company's biggest business by far."

Market watchers will have braced for even worse to come. One could smell the rubber yesterday as they sharply reversed uphill 13 per cent after a more bullish trading update. Shares in rivals Pirelli and Continental also rose strongly.
Why the about-turn? Michelin had sought to ensure maximum transparency about its various markets late last year. The subsequent share price volatility will no doubt have worried some in the market and does not help give the impression of stability. Nevertheless investors should see Michelin offering protection on a precarious road. 
As the global auto sector enters a cyclical downturn, Michelin does hold some defensive qualities. Car drivers and global logistics companies may not buy as many new vehicles. They still have to replace their tyres. 
Better than expected volumes and profits in the second half of last year reflected surprisingly strong North American sales, which compensated for China’s weaknesses. Michelin also pushed through price increases to defend profit margins — and its premium brand strategy. Its cautious optimism about 2019 contrasted with a warning last week from US rival Goodyear stating that headwinds had persisted beyond the fourth quarter. 
Crucially, Michelin’s free cash flow, at almost €1.3bn last year, exceeded expectations, too, and is targeted to reach more than €1.45bn in 2019. That more than covers a dividend yielding nearly 4 per cent. Yes, auto companies are struggling. Yet, Michelin is less reliant on China and sales in volatile emerging markets currencies than its largest rivals, Continental and Bridgestone. Finances are strong enough that Michelin has not ruled out share buybacks this year. 
While “Car-maggedon” may not occur, the automotive slowdown will have ripple effects on the tyremakers. But among those, Michelin should absorb most of the shocks.

“You look out of touch with your customers if you say you can only have our software and our capabilities if you adopt everything only from us,” Kirsch said.
Nick Patience, a founder and research vice president for 451 Research, said the move is “an acknowledgment by IBM that its a hybrid cloud world,” referring to firms wanting to use more than one cloud computing vendor as well as keeping some software running in their internal data centers.
Cloud computing companies like Amazon and Microsoft are pushing artificial intelligence because using technologies like deep learning typically require processing huge amounts of data through their cloud services, Patience explained. IBM deciding to make Watson available on competing cloud services could be a sign that “IBM is acknowledging that AWS, Microsoft, and Google are leading the pack in machine learning,” he said.
Kirsch explained that being more open could help IBM win customers that are concerned about being locked into one company’s cloud service for AI projects. In this way, they’ll be relatively free to pick and chose.
IBM’s new service, Cloud Private for Data (ICP for Data), is built on the popular open source IT software Kubernetes, which was developed by Google as a way to manage data center infrastructure. The free software has become popular with developers because they can use the technology to build complex apps that are powered by multiple databases and services that theoretically don’t have to be tethered to a single cloud provider.
With the new technology, IBM customers can use Watson to do things like build machine-learning models and create digital chatbots.
Thomas said IBM hasn’t set a price for the new service and it will likely be tiered based on the customers’ needs. Additionally, while the service is currently compatible with only North American cloud providers like AWS, Asian cloud vendors like China tech giant Alibaba could be added in the future, Thomas said.
Get Data Sheet, Fortunes technology newsletter.
Still, Thomas argues that the best way to run Watson is through IBM’s own cloud computing service. Customers using it can choose from multiple hardware and computer chip configurations that squeeze the most power out of Watson.
“We are confident in the IBM cloud that if clients try our products anywhere, they will eventually be drawn to IBM cloud and the uniqueness it provides,” said Thomas.
Although companies are concerned about being locked into a specific company’s cloud infrastructure when it comes to certain software and IT products, Patience said they are currently in the early stages of using AI and are still willing to upload their corporate data to cloud services like AWS and rely on them for machine learning software. Being locked into a particular vendor when it comes to machine learning projects isn’t yet much of a concern, but IBM is betting that will change.
“We dont hear a load of companies banging on the door saying, ‘This is outrageous, we demand more portability,'” Patience said.
He continued: “You could say IBM is trying to take back the initiative in machine learning here. The Watson brand has lost a little bit of luster over the years as others has come along. They are trying to take it back.”"

 Amazon will also create a custom storefront on its site specifically for the event where customers can shop and select one of the Amazon Lockers at Coachella as their shipping address. According to a press release, once their package is ready for pickup, customers will receive an e-mail along with a barcode. Amazon only allows items purchased on Amazon to be shipped to its lockers, so festival goers won't be able to send themselves a care package or ship personal items from home. 
 The custom storefront will include items from camping essentials to fashion and wellness products.

 Whether or not Amazon Lockers will be available for the festivals in the years going forward is unknown. Yet, the move once again serves as a signal that Amazon is cementing itself as the most convenient — and popular — retailer in the country."

 Almost in unison, strategists urged investors to beef up their holdings of cash and its equivalents like Treasury bills. 
 There were two main reasons. First, the stock market's volatility and the outlook for even more gyrations this year raised the importance of having a safety hedge. Second, short-term interest rates had risen high enough to be an attractive alternative to riskier assets — so much so that cash was the best-performing asset class of 2018. 
 It turns out investors heeded the advice, which had poured in from all corners of the sell side. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's fund manager survey for February, the rotation into cash lifted traders' overweight position to its highest level since the Great Recession in January 2009. Their net cash allocation specifically jumped six percentage points to 44%. 
 The BAML survey included fund managers who oversee a combined $515 billion in assets. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
This rotation to cash happened at the expense of stocks. In February, fund managers reported the smallest overweight in equities since September 2016. 
 What makes this rotation more striking, besides the post-crisis milestone, is that investors beefed up on cash even as stocks surged in January. 
 At first blush, it's a sign that investors are becoming more averse to taking risk in the stock market and would rather hold on to dry powder. 
 However, Bank of America interprets the survey results differently. Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist, said in a note to clients that bearish investor positioning remains a positive for asset prices in the first quarter. 
 His conclusion is derived from the fund manager survey's ""cash rule."" It triggers a contrarian buy signal when the average cash balance rise above 4.5%, and a contrarian sell signal when the balance falls below 3.5%. 
 After all, more cash means that investors have more dry powder to deploy when they spot an attractive opportunity in the stock market. And as the chart above shows, huge cash piles are always put to work eventually."

As part of its crackdown on tax avoidance, the European Commission three years ago ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros ($790 million) from the group, saying the companies’ “excess profit” tax plan gave them an unfair advantage vis-a-vis smaller firms. 
The scheme allowed the companies to claim deductions for economies of scale, reducing their corporate tax base by 50-90 percent. 
Dutch industrial company Magnetrol and Belgium subsequently challenged the Commission’s decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. The largest beneficiaries were Wabco, Cellio, BP, BASF, Atlas Copco and Belgacom. 
Judges may also rule whether it qualifies as a scheme or are just individual tax rulings. 
The tax avoidance drive has included orders to Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple and Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler, 250 million euros from Amazon and about 120 million euros from Engie. 
The Netherlands has to recover between 20-30 million euros from Starbucks. 
All the major companies have challenged the EU rulings. At stake is whether the Commission is over-stretching its powers by using its state aid tool to address tax fairness concerns. 
The United States has criticized the cases against U.S. companies and notably in the Apple ruling it has accused the EU of grabbing revenue intended for U.S. coffers. 
The cases are T-131/16 Belgium v Commission and T-263/16 Magnetrol International v Commission.

But Plus500 investors had reason to suspect their luck would run out. The Israeli online trading company was one of the best FTSE 350 performers in 2018 with an 82 per cent return. On Tuesday, the shares fell by almost 30 per cent after it warned that this year’s profits would disappoint. 
The company pinned the blame on a move by European regulators to protect amateur traders from racking up heavy losses on derivatives. The August crackdown limited the amount customers could borrow to juice up their bets. The effects were evident in a near halving of the number of new customers in 2018 and a near doubling of the cost of acquiring them. Only 2 per cent of the customers who were active in 2018 have so far been categorised as professionals, allowing them to escape leverage restraints.
However, the fallout from tough regulations was predictable. London-listed rivals CMC Markets and IG Group have acknowledged the crackdown’s toll. Plus500 founders have offloaded stock: one sold £31m of shares in December. Short-sellers have piled in, hinting at further pain. With a tenth of shares out on loan, Plus500 is the fifth most-shorted UK stock. 
But bulls caught out by Tuesday’s news should feel aggrieved. Management predicted in November and December that 2018 profits would beat expectations. Reassurances about the group’s performance since the August regulatory changes were issued just seven weeks ago. True, that was borne out by Tuesday’s figures showing a 90 per cent rise in net profit for the year. But the explanation was less reassuring. The surge in revenues in the fourth quarter was entirely down to customers’ bad bets, coming amid wild market moves. 
That flattering of profits looks unsustainable. More worrying is the implications for the stability of the business. Plus500 has always said it made its money from spreads, the difference between the price at which customers can buy and sell, plus any overnight interest charges. The statistics bear that out: profits from its customers’ losses were just 3 per cent of revenues over five years. But behind that figure is a lot of volatility. In 2018 there was a gain of $172m; in 2017 a loss of $103m. That suggests a weaker quality of earnings than thought.
For Plus500, past events do influence the future. The shares remain a gamble to avoid.

While Saudi Arabia has never been less than an absolute monarchy, for the first time since Ibn Saud it now had an absolute monarch taking command. Apologists for his authoritarianism ran the gamut of clichés and nostrums, from “we live in a tough neighbourhood” to Alexis de Tocqueville’s “the most dangerous moment for a bad regime is when it begins to reform”.

Uniteds rebirth under Solskjaer couldnt have been any more poorly timed as far as PSG counterpart Thomas Tuchel is concerned. Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, and Anthony Martial have lit up Old Trafford in recent weeks, helping guide the rejuvenated Premier League outfit to a record of 10 wins and one draw under their Norwegian coach.
This will be the first competitive meeting between these two teams; PSG triumphed 2-0 in their only previous encountera 2-0 International Champions Cup win in Chicago in 2015.
Following Neymars metatarsal injury earlier this winter, Cavani suffered a knock to his hip during Saturdays 1-0 Ligue 1 win over Bordeaux, ruling him out of Tuesdays first leg as well.
PSG will also miss right-back, Thomas Meunier, after he suffered a concussion against Bordeaux, while Marco Verratti only just made his return from injury with a 60-minute display.
Talismanic 20-year-old Kylian Mbappe remains as the last bastion of Tuchels usual three-pronged attack, but per Goal.com, the manager recently said its not the Frenchmans job to replace Neymar and Cavani:
“You can’t place all of the burden and pressure on him. It’s not his job to replace Cavani and Neymar and he can’t play all three roles at once. I want us to provide him the right kind of support. You cannot replace quality players, and we cannot replace Neymar. Manchester United could not replace Pogba or Rashford. We cannot replace Neymar.”
United looked lost under Jose Mourinho and destined to fall in the round of 16. However, Solskjaer has instilled new belief, and the right result in this first leg could blaze a trail to a surprise berth in the quarter-finals.

 Air New Zealand flight NZ289, which was supposed to fly from Auckland to Shanghai, made the U-turn about three hours into the flight, according to flight tracking site FlightRadar24. The flight is usually about 11 hours long. 
 The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was located just off New Caledonia island in the South Pacific when it turned back to Auckland Airport.

The reasons for the U-turn remain unclear. While Air New Zealand said it was because the aircraft used on Saturday was ""not yet certified to operate to China,"" New Zealand news site Stuff reported that it was because the airline had angered Beijing by listing the self-governing island of Taiwan as part of China. 
 A spokesman for the airline told The Guardian: ""This issue relates to a particular aircraft which is not yet certified to operate to China but was unfortunately assigned to operate our Shanghai flight on Saturday night. 
 ""Yesterday Air New Zealand was advised that the original application to have this aircraft registered to operate to China had expired and a fresh application was submitted,"" they added.

Citing unnamed sources, on Tuesday Stuff reported that the paperwork in question had made a reference to Taiwan, which China saw as an acknowledgement of Taiwan's status as an individual country. Taiwan has for decades operated as its own country, but Beijing insists that Taiwan belongs to it. 
 ""The Chinese were very explicit"" about its problem with the aircraft's paperwork, and it was not resolved before the Saturday flight, Stuff cited its sources as saying. 
 Business Insider has contacted Air New Zealand for comment on the Saturday flight and its reference to Taiwan. 
 Air New Zealand runs at least one NZ289 flight every day. No other NZ289 flights have been affected, according to FlightRadar24.

A 'very unusual' situation 
 John Nicholson, CEO of Aviation New Zealand, told The Guardian that the incident was ""very unusual."" 
 ""It gets into the political situation and the way the different governments recognize or don't recognize states, and I would think Air New Zealand would be guided very much by what the New Zealand government position is,"" he said, adding that people should ""therefore look at it in context of the New Zealand government's relationship with China."" 
 New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern hit back at insinuations that the flight's U-turn was a reflection of Wellington and Beijing's diplomatic relationship. 
 She told the TVNZ network: ""I think it would be wrong to confuse administrative and regulatory issues as signals on our relationship [with China]. 
 ""Spreading misinformation around issues like this flight, I have to say, I see as irresponsible and a real departure from what we've experienced in foreign policy before,"" she added.

China's increasing pressure on Taiwan 
 Beijing has increased its pressure on making Taiwan a subject of China since Tsai Ing-wen, a pro-Taiwanese independence politician, became president in 2016. 
 Dozens of countries cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan over the past year, leaving the island nation with just 17 allies left. Taipei blamed the trend on China's ""dollar diplomacy""— the practice of using foreign aid and investment to pressure economic allies to cut ties. 
 China demanded 36 foreign airlines to remove references to Taiwan as countries on their website and marketing materials last year. The airlines were asked to refer to destinations in those regions as Chinese territories instead. 
 China and Taiwan's militaries have been acting increasingly belligerently toward each other as well. The Pentagon warned last month that China might feel confident enough to use military force against Taiwan.

""You will see us accelerate the growth even faster than we have to date,"" Kurian said at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. Previously, he said, Google nearly quadrupled its sales and distribution functions.
The comments come as Google looks to challenge the cloud market leaders, Amazon and Microsoft.
""We are hiring some of the best talent from around the industry to grow our sales organization, and you will see us competing much more aggressively as we go forward,"" said Kurian, who in September left Oracle as its president of product development and in November was named as the new Google Cloud CEO to replace Diane Greene.
At Oracle Kurian was in charge of a 35,000-person team focused on software development across 32 countries, according to his LinkedIn profile. Now he's in charge of Google's overall cloud business, including the Google Cloud Platform public cloud and the G Suite productivity apps for business.
At the conference, Kurian highlighted several products and pointed to several Google cloud customers using those products, including BNP Paribas, the city of Los Angeles, Home Depot, KeyBank and Telegraph Media Group.
Now the company will focus more on individual industries like financial services and work more with channel partners, Kurian said. The company is also introducing a Cloud For Life program to keep existing customers and bring in new ones.
""I talked to some of largest companies and said, 'Why did you choose Google?' And uniformly, the feedback I got is 'It's by far the best technology in the market, the technology is amazing, I've never seen anything like it.' This is what I heard over and over again,"" Kurian said.
 It's not clear how much revenue comes from each half.
""In terms of growth, cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth, driven by GCP; and GCP does remain one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet,"" Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We've doubled the number of GCP contracts greater than $1 million. We're also seeing early nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there.""
But unlike market leader Amazon, Google hasn't specified exactly how much revenue it gets each quarter -- just that it gets more than $1 billion per quarter, between the public cloud and the cloud apps, combined. Amazon's cloud revenue was $7.43 billion last quarter, the company reported.
In a question-and-answer session, one person asked for a financial update, and Kurian declined to elaborate. He said that Porat and Google CEO Sundar Pichai will disclose more ""if they choose to.""

 His response to that is to point out how trucking compares to, say, the energy industry. Trucking transportation services are a $726 billion market, while petroleum refining total $501 billion in the US. 
 And trucking is about to catch up to energy in one significant way. On March 29, the country's first trucking freight futures market will sound its opening bell. That means the tens of thousands of firms who use trucks to move their goods will be able to better forecast what transport costs will total as far as 16 months ahead; transportation costs represent some 8% of US GDP. 
 ""People always think about energy prices as creating inflation in the market,"" Fuller told Business Insider. ""Trucking and transportation is actually a bigger cost."" 
 The freight futures market will be in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It's in partnership with FreightWaves, DAT, and Nodal Exchange. 
Read more:A 4-year-old trucking startup achieved a major victory in fixing one of transportation's biggest inefficiencies — and it's a huge win for truck drivers
 Trucking is a massive industry that touches many parts of consumers' lives. According to Fuller, there are more than 4,500 trucking companies that bring in more than $20 million in revenue annually. 
 And there are 20,000 shippers who spend more than $10 million on trucking costs every year. Everyone ranging from Kellogg's to Amazon to ExxonMobil needs to forecast their transportation costs. 
 Not only is trucking huge, it's also incredibly volatile. Rates last year jumped so much that major companies had to jack up the prices of their goods just to keep up. According to FreightWaves, 40% of Fortune 500 companies reported in late 2017 and in 2018 that transportation costs were harming their bottom lines. 
 Fuller described 2018 as the trucking industry's ""OPEC moment"" — when an entire industry realized just how volatile conditions, pricing, capacity, and labor issues can get. A futures market might be able to help transportation companies, and everyone who depends on trucking to move goods, ensure prices will remain stable. 
 ""Once you add visibility and transparency to it with a futures contract, what will happen is that the delta between the high number and the low number will actually come down,"" Fuller said. ""What you end up doing is you mitigate your volatility."""

Valentine's Day doesn't have to be reserved for couples. Love is love whether you have a partner or are loving on yourself. 
Feb. 14 is right around the corner, and if you find yourself dreading seeing everyone coupled up and in love don't. We get it, all the #relationshipgoals and lovey dovey messages on your social media feed can get a tad nauseating no one cares about your basic box of assorted chocolates and dozen mediocre red roses, Kris! 
OK, back to self-love. You should definitely love yourself every day, but why not take the holiday of love to celebrate how amazing you are.
This year (and honestly every year) choo-choo-choose yourself.
Here are a few tips on how to be your best Valentine to date. 
Write yourself a love letter
Have you looked in a mirror lately? Because, wow, you are gorgeous (inside and out). Why not write your bad self a love letter to show your appreciation?
Wellness practitioner Liana Naima suggests gifting yourself a love letter by using one of these prompts: 
I love you because 
I appreciate you because 
I have grown into 
I recognize that 
This will give you time to reflect on all the reasons you love and appreciate yourself and see how much you've personally grown.
Last SlideNext Slide
Take yourself on a movie date
OK, a solo movie date may sound a little bit sad at first, but hear us out. You don't have to compromise on where to sit in the theater, take your pick. The (movie theater) world is your oyster.
You also don't have to miss important scenes because your date is constantly asking questions about the plot. You never have to coordinate timing; you can take yourself to the movies whenever you want because you're on no one's time but your own.

If you're going with the latter option, you have full control over how simple or luxurious you want your spa day to be.

Meditate on some chocolates
Did someone say chocolate? 
The wellness blogger recommends buying a box of your favorite chocolates (a plus is that you don't have to share the box with anyone) and meditating.

Naima says that meditation can improve your ability to be introspective and can make you more compassionate.

 The organic grocer has raised prices on some items while discontinuing others, according to a leaked email reported by the Wall Street Journal. 
 A Whole Foods spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider that the higher prices were due to rising material, packaging, and transportation costs. 
 The increase is due to some item-specific contracts expiring. Of about 700 items with expiring contracts, the grocer says it has decided to stop selling about half and raise prices on less than 50. 
 ""Like all grocers, Whole Foods Market has experienced increased costs from suppliers due to materials, labor and transportation, and we've absorbed much of the inflation,"" a Whole Foods spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Many prices have also decreased, and we continue to expand the number of promotions we offer to give our customers better value.""

 Of new contracts, more than 100 items are also seeing net price reductions, the spokesperson said. The items are chosen for renewal or promotion based on customer buying habits. 
 These new price changes come after the highly publicized price reductions Amazon made when it purchased Whole Foods in 2017. The price cuts were made to ease the grocer's ""Whole Paycheck"" image — in other words, that it's too expensive for the average consumer. 
 Whole Foods says it isn't pulling away from that initiative. 
 ""We remain committed to continuing to lower prices with Amazon as we deliver on our mission to make high-quality, natural and organic food more affordable and accessible,"" a Whole Foods spokeswoman said in a statement. 
 Rising food prices are not a retailer-specific problem. Higher transportation costs fueled by a truck driver shortage have been steadily affecting the price of consumer goods for years now. That forces retailers to either absorb the increased costs or pass them on the consumer."
1,2,New York Needs Amazon,History is clear: A city that rejects economic opportunity will lose its status as the center of the business world.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/amazon-hq2-new-york.html,the-new-york-times,2019-02-12 17:15:44,The potential loss of the Amazon headquarters would be more akin to a longterm disaster During the 20th century the city lost its two main economic underpinnings its manufacturing base and its role as the busiest seaport on earth In 1955 for example about a million people worked in New York Citys factories and in its crowded harbor tramp steamers ocean liners and tugboats struggled to avoid one another New York was the leading industrial city in the worldAnd yet by 1980 a quartercentury later the major job centers in the five boroughs had essentially collapsed In 1900 New York had 90 breweries and was the beer capital of the nation But by 1976 the last brewery in the city was gone and Milwaukee and St Louis were competing for beer supremacy Similarly in 1950 New Yorks 300000 textile workers made most of the womens clothes sold in the United States The city had no serious rival But by 2017 only about 20000 such workers remained New Yorks job losses were not only bluecollar During the 1970s the city experienced an exodus of Fortune 500 corporations Dozens of them moved their headquarters and took their executives with them Some went to suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey but many more decamped for Atlanta Dallas or Houston The impact on the city was dramatic Not only did workers laid off from those companies lose their jobs but their spouses and children suffered as well Many of them as demographic statistics reveal had to move to other states to make a living Their departure was hidden by the fact that they were often replaced by millions of newcomers from other countries but those immigrants could not immediately compensate for all those lost jobsThe region now faces a calamity almost as bad as anything that has happened in the past The loss of Amazon would cost 25000 jobs directly and those workers would support up to 82000 more indirect jobs The subsidies New York has offered to Amazon would have been given to any company promising so many jobs And Amazon is expected to pay more than 27 billion in taxes over the next 25 years Amazon will also build four million square feet of office space in Queens providing billions more in construction spending More important a new Amazon headquarters on the East River would signal that the future of this metropolis is as great as its past,"The potential loss of the Amazon headquarters would be more akin to a long-term disaster. During the 20th century, the city lost its two main economic underpinnings: its manufacturing base and its role as the busiest seaport on earth. In 1955, for example, about a million people worked in New York Citys factories, and in its crowded harbor, tramp steamers, ocean liners and tugboats struggled to avoid one another. New York was the leading industrial city in the world.
And yet, by 1980, a quarter-century later, the major job centers in the five boroughs had essentially collapsed. In 1900, New York had 90 breweries and was the beer capital of the nation. But by 1976, the last brewery in the city was gone, and Milwaukee and St. Louis were competing for beer supremacy. Similarly, in 1950, New Yorks 300,000 textile workers made most of the womens clothes sold in the United States. The city had no serious rival. But by 2017, only about 20,000 such workers remained. 
New Yorks job losses were not only blue-collar. During the 1970s, the city experienced an exodus of Fortune 500 corporations. Dozens of them moved their headquarters and took their executives with them. Some went to suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey, but many more decamped for Atlanta, Dallas or Houston. The impact on the city was dramatic. Not only did workers laid off from those companies lose their jobs, but their spouses and children suffered as well. Many of them, as demographic statistics reveal, had to move to other states to make a living. Their departure was hidden by the fact that they were often replaced by millions of newcomers from other countries, but those immigrants could not immediately compensate for all those lost jobs.
The region now faces a calamity almost as bad as anything that has happened in the past. The loss of Amazon would cost 25,000 jobs directly, and those workers would support up to 82,000 more indirect jobs. The subsidies New York has offered to Amazon would have been given to any company promising so many jobs. And Amazon is expected to pay more than $27 billion in taxes over the next 25 years. Amazon will also build four million square feet of office space in Queens, providing billions more in construction spending. 
More important, a new Amazon headquarters on the East River would signal that the future of this metropolis is as great as its past."

Its poetically fitting that Sandra Cisneros, the Chicana literary trailblazer and best-selling novelist, plans to donate the cash prize that comes with winning this year's International PEN/Nabokov Award to her assistants so they can buy a home.
Home, in the physical and metaphorical sense, has been a central theme for Cisneros since her literary debut in 1980.
With money and fame comes responsibility, and the amount is exactly what they need, she said in a phone interview from her home in San Miguel de Allende, the stunning colonial city in central Mexico where she has lived since 2013. Theyve been looking for loans, and the interest in Mexico is 39 percent. I cant describe how happy it makes me to be able to do this for them.

""I believe that there is a law in the universe that all the work we do is in service to those we love and it's always going to bring us better rewards and fortune. It puts us in a state of grace when you are in service to your community,"" she said.
Cisneros, born in Chicago in 1954 to Mexican immigrants, is a writer-activist who came of age in 1970s-era of Black Power and the Chicano civil rights movement. She says she writes out of a sense of urgency because the world we live in is a house on fire and the people we love are burning. Writing for her is not just a political act but also a spiritual one.

The idea of writing a best-seller was not on my mind when I wrote 'The House on Mango Street,' she said. I wrote it to stop the swelling in my heart from the stories that I was hearing and witnessing.

Dutch industrial company Magnetrol and Belgium subsequently challenged the Commission’s decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. The largest beneficiaries were Wabco, Cellio, BP, BASF, Atlas Copco and Belgacom. 
Judges may also rule whether it qualifies as a scheme or are just individual tax rulings. 
The tax avoidance drive has included orders to Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple and Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler, 250 million euros from Amazon and about 120 million euros from Engie. 
The Netherlands has to recover between 20-30 million euros from Starbucks. 
All the major companies have challenged the EU rulings. At stake is whether the Commission is over-stretching its powers by using its state aid tool to address tax fairness concerns. 
The United States has criticised the cases against U.S. companies and notably in the Apple ruling it has accused the EU of grabbing revenue intended for U.S. coffers. 
The cases are T-131/16 Belgium v Commission and T-263/16 Magnetrol International v Commission.

The online retail behemoth has reportedly been reducing the portion of shipments it puts in cardboard boxes in favor of lighter plastic mailers over the past year, which allows it to pack more packages into trucks and planes.
However, according to a Washington Post report, environmental activists and waste experts have said the plastic mailers are having a negative effect.
“That Amazon packaging suffers from the same problems as plastic bags, which are not sortable in our recycling system and get caught in the machinery,” Lisa Sepanski, project manager for King County Solid Waste Division, which oversees recycling in King County, Wash., where Amazon is based, told the Post. “It takes labor to cut them out. They have to stop the machinery.”

Amazon now accounts for about half of all e-commerce in the United States, according to 2018 analysis by research firm eMarketer, so it's the primary source of the plastic containers. Other companies, including Target, also use them.
The plastic mailers are responsible for several problems, the Post added. In general, they should be recycled separately, but if they do end up in the normal recycling stream, they prevent larger bundles of materials from being recycled by gumming up the system, the report said.
Waste experts consulted by the publication noted that plastic can be better for the environment since they take up less space, thereby making shipping more efficient. Fewer greenhouse gases are emitted in the production and use of plastic film, a senior environmental policy analyst told the Post.

Since the plastic mailers also have paper address labels affixed to them, that creates a separate issue since the label must be removed before the mailer can be recycled with other plastic.
“We are continually working to improve our packaging and recycling options, and have reduced packaging waste by more than 20 percent globally in 2018,” an Amazon spokesperson told the Post.

the shows that happened before the Oscars he said We were just staring at it and it looked like we were in a bookies office It had flow charts who was walking out and presenting what We were tracking who was showing up at each awards show I looked at Bill and was like How are we going to make this feel special  In the dogeatdog world that is Hollywood many feel the biggest dog needs to own the turf better And it seems the Academy has finally caught on In 2020 the Oscars will air on February 9 marking the earliest the show has ever been presented But some think it should be in January  The

awards Mechanic said Theres one award that matters and thats the only thing to protect Theres nothing else that matters  ABC has more control of the show than ever before  When it comes to the Oscars theres no way to satisfy everyone  As Margolis put it From the fade up from black to the fade out at the end everybody is looking for something to hate during that show  But despite all the negative reviews posted the following day and complaints that go viral that show is still a huge moneymaker for ABC  The network which in 2016 extended its contract to air the Oscars through 2028 has consistently raised the cost of the ad spots that run during the telecast In 2017 it was 191 million per 30second spot last year it was 2 million and this year 3 million  Its a phenomenon thats going on with all live mustsee TV ratings are sliding but brands still believe its worth being there  If youre a sponsor and youre trying to reach any kind of mass appeal you sort of grab at the platforms that can still do that CNN media critic Brian Lowry said The Oscars is in the same way that sports have an advantage if you are really into the Oscars you dont want to DVR it and watch the next day I wouldnt be surprised to see Netflix Amazon or HBO ponying up for some ads during the Oscars because to launch your new spring shows its going to be one of the last big platforms to reach a lot of people Yutong YuanBusiness Insider But ABC is now doing more than just selling ads  The network is through standing back and letting the Academy have full control of the show which is how it had been for decades One of the stipulations in the 2016 contract extension was that ABC now has more say in key creative aspects of the show The choice of host and producer is now a discussion between ABC and the Academy though the Academy has final say This is why in the last two years youve seen a lot more ABCDisney elements on the show like Jimmy Kimmel hosting and using Disney titles in his stunts  Sources told Business Insider that for years ABC has wanted the show to only be three hours long so coming off a year that had the worst ratings ever its safe to say the network has more leverage than ever when it comes to run time Read more The 15 Oscar bestpicture winners that made the most money at the US box office There is going to come a time when ABC expects the Academy to continue to

James Cameron celebrating his best director win for Titanic at the 70th Academy Awards in 1998 which were seen by over 57 million people AP This has to be said nobody does this show to fail Shankman said Everybody goes in wanting desperately to do the best job that they can and to honor the evening and to honor the people that are involved Even the years that have been lowest in the ratings there have been wonderful parts of the show  But it is hard to balance all the forces at play ratings artistic integrity tradition freshness Often what you end up with is a show that satisfies no one  The show has stopped being what its supposed to be which is a way to acknowledge each other Zanuck said Thats why it started as a dinner No one was worried about what someone in Oklahoma thought When it sounds like you need some gimmick to get people to watch its so desperate and I think in a lot of ways that desperate feeling is whats going to take it all down The show has to get its integrity back Winning an Oscar has got to mean something If it keeps with these gasping for air moves I dont know where it can go  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not respond to Business Insiders numerous requests to comment for this story,"Since 1929, the Academy Awards ceremony has been the biggest night in Hollywood.

 It feels like the Oscars are at a dire crossroads, from the telecast's sagging ratings to its lack of diversity — which was pushed front-and-center by #OscarsSoWhite in 2015 — to this year's hosting drama, and the stripping of categories from the live broadcast. 
 But some within Hollywood believe their big night has been on life support for some time. 
 Business Insider spoke to past Oscar show producers, Academy voters, and award show pundits to learn about the numerous attempts over the last two decades to make the Oscars telecast more modern. Despite these attempts, the show always seems to revert back to its more traditional form, and many in the industry think that's a terrible trend. 
 ""The show needs to change,"" Bill Mechanic, an Oscar-nominated producer who resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' board of governors last year, told Business Insider. ""But not in a way that it's watered down in terms of its artistic measurement, in fact, that should be preserved."" 
 Here we investigate what has gone wrong with the Academy Awards and what needs to be fixed. 
 Where new ideas go to die 
 The last time the Oscars didn't have a host was in 1989, and that year will forever be known for having the worst opening in the show's history: an 11 minute-plus musical number that followed Snow White as she navigated through different eras of Hollywood and all its glamour. It ended with her doing a duet with — wait for it — Rob Lowe. 
 The backlash was immediate, including Disney suing the Academy for using the likeness of Snow White, and changed the course of the Oscar show forever. A review committee was formed to audit the show from top to bottom, leading to former DGA president Gil Cates producing the show the following year. He brought on Billy Crystal to host, which led to the Oscars' golden years.

Everything surrounding the 2019 Oscars makes it feel like the show is facing another moment when change is needed. But it can't seem to get out of its own way. 
 Following the record-low ratings of last year's show, the Academy's attempt to rebound has been crippled by bad publicity. 
 When word hit in August that a popular movie category at the Oscars was being considered, the outrage came from both the public and the industry. Then in early December Kevin Hart walked away from hosting this year's show following an uproar over his past homophobic remarks, leaving the evening without a host. That was followed by a short-lived attempt to control the show's run time by cutting out some of the performances from the best song nominees, and a new plan, announced Monday, to give out some technical awards during commercial breaks. 
 The relegation of some awards to commercial breaks has angered many in Hollywood. 
 ""To be at the show and your award not to be worthy, I think it's somewhat insulting,"" Lili Fini Zanuck, who produced the 72nd Oscars in 2000 with her husband Richard D. Zanuck (the two produced best picture winner ""Driving Miss Daisy""), told Business Insider regarding the decision to not televise live all 24 award categories. 
 This kind of erratic maneuvering by the Academy is exactly the reason Bill Mechanic resigned from its board of governors last year. 
 In a strongly worded farewell letter that Variety got its hands on, Mechanic — a former Fox executive, producer of the 82nd Oscars in 2010, and producer of best-picture nominee ""Hacksaw Ridge"" — said they had ""failed to move the Oscars into the modern age."" He said the show was ""long and boring"" and that over the past decade, the Academy had ""nominated so many smaller independent films that the Oscars feel like they should be handed out in a tent."" 
Kevin Hart was named host of the 91st Academy Awards, but backed out followed backlash from homophobic tweets and stand-up material.

 ""A lot of people in the Academy don't want to change anything and I think they are wrong not from a purist standpoint but from an entertainment standpoint,"" Mechanic said.

No host is the best thing that could have happened
 Since the Academy is so resistant to change, the Oscars not having a host might be great for this year's telecast, since it forces everyone involved to get out of their comfort zone. 
 ""If you book presenters properly and they are big enough stars, you don't need a host,"" said Jeff Margolis, who directed the Oscars telecast eight times, many of them in the show's glory days alongside Cates. 
 And Margolis knows a little something about doing the show without a host. The first ever Oscars he directed was in 1989, the last time the show didn't have one. Though that show was infamous because of the Snow White opening, Margolis believes what Allan Carr, that year's producer, did right was booking interesting presenters. 
 ""Allan called it, 'couples, companions, and compadres,'"" Margolis said about how they put together the presenters. ""And it really worked."" 
 The show featured presenters ranging from hot ""it"" couples of the time (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) to legendary duos from the movies (""Vertigo"" stars Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak). 
 Shankman, who produced the 82nd Oscars with Mechanic, pulled off the rare two-person-hosted show with Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin (the show was one of the highest-rated in the last decade). But his favorite moment didn't involve the hosts. 
 ""My year we had Robert Downey Jr. and Tina Fey present original screenplay, and I could have watched them all night, they weren't the hosts,"" he said.

 And Ian Stewart — who has worked on everything from the 2012 Olympics opening ceremonies, to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show — believes in today's world it's less about finding the right host and more about crafting viral content that can spread on social media. 
 ""I certainly have a check list on my productions of what are the 10 viral moments that we would hope to facilitate,"" he said. ""I think it's up to us to create those viral moments."" 
 Is it time to disrupt the bloated award season? 
 With some changes coming to this year's Oscars, and some of the biggest blockbusters of the year nominated for best picture (""Black Panther,"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" ""A Star Is Born""), the telecast could be headed for a rebound year. 
 But even if the 91st Oscars are produced in a way that keeps viewers engaged, there's still the issue of the time of year the ceremony takes place, which many believe is hurting the show. 
 Since the start of the Oscars almost a century ago, many other award shows have sprung up around it.

 There are around 14 award ceremonies before the Oscars, from the ones televised (Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice Awards, Independent Spirit Awards) to the many more that aren't (Gotham Awards, National Society of Film Critics Awards, Producers Guild, Directors Guild, Screenwriters Guild). And because of social media and the horse-race coverage of the Oscars lead-up, many are burnt out by the time the big night arrives. 
 ""I love movies, and I'm in the business, and I'm even tired of seeing Hollywood pat themselves on the back so many times,"" one Academy voter said.

 ""They are going to make everybody else fit in a smaller window,"" Gold Derby managing editor Chris Beachum said. ""These non-televised events, they all rely on that evening being a big moneymaker for themselves — selling programs, advertisements, tables. They can't afford to give up that night. So now you're going to cause all of these award shows to fit into a much smaller window."" 
 Some aren't as compassionate about this potential dilemma to award season. 
 ""The Academy should push everybody out of business in terms of the awards,"" Mechanic said. ""There's one award that matters and that's the only thing to protect. There's nothing else that matters."" 
 ABC has more control of the show than ever before 
 When it comes to the Oscars, there's no way to satisfy everyone. 
 As Margolis put it, ""From the fade up from black to the fade out at the end, everybody is looking for something to hate during that show."" 
 But despite all the negative reviews posted the following day, and complaints that go viral, that show is still a huge moneymaker for ABC. 
 The network, which in 2016 extended its contract to air the Oscars through 2028, has consistently raised the cost of the ad spots that run during the telecast. In 2017, it was $1.91 million per 30-second spot; last year, it was $2 million; and this year, $3 million. 
 It's a phenomenon that's going on with all live ""must-see"" TV: ratings are sliding, but brands still believe it's worth being there. 
 ""If you're a sponsor and you're trying to reach any kind of mass appeal, you sort of grab at the platforms that can still do that,"" CNN media critic Brian Lowry said. ""The Oscars is in the same way that sports have an advantage, if you are really into the Oscars, you don't want to DVR it and watch the next day. I wouldn't be surprised to see Netflix, Amazon, or HBO ponying up for some ads during the Oscars because to launch your new spring shows it's going to be one of the last big platforms to reach a lot of people."" 
Yutong Yuan/Business Insider 
But ABC is now doing more than just selling ads. 
 The network is through standing back and letting the Academy have full control of the show, which is how it had been for decades. One of the stipulations in the 2016 contract extension was that ABC now has more say in key creative aspects of the show. The choice of host and producer is now a discussion between ABC and the Academy (though the Academy has final say). This is why in the last two years you've seen a lot more ABC/Disney elements on the show, like Jimmy Kimmel hosting and using Disney titles in his stunts. 
 Sources told Business Insider that for years ABC has wanted the show to only be three hours long, so coming off a year that had the worst ratings ever, it's safe to say the network has more leverage than ever when it comes to run time.

 ""There is going to come a time when ABC expects the Academy to continue to deliver the product that they thought they were buying,"" Feinberg said. ""So far since that contract was extended I don't think they can be all that pleased by what they've got."" 
The Oscars' high water mark. James Cameron celebrating his best director win for ""Titanic"" at the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, which were seen by over 57 million people.

""This has to be said, nobody does this show to fail,"" Shankman said. ""Everybody goes in wanting desperately to do the best job that they can and to honor the evening and to honor the people that are involved. Even the years that have been lowest in the ratings, there have been wonderful parts of the show."" 
 But it is hard to balance all the forces at play: ratings, artistic integrity, tradition, freshness. Often what you end up with is a show that satisfies no one. 
 ""The show has stopped being what it's supposed to be, which is a way to acknowledge each other,"" Zanuck said. ""That's why it started as a dinner. No one was worried about what someone in Oklahoma thought. When it sounds like you need some gimmick to get people to watch, it's so desperate and I think in a lot of ways that desperate feeling is what's going to take it all down. The show has to get its integrity back. Winning an Oscar has got to mean something. If it keeps with these gasping for air moves, I don't know where it can go."" 
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not respond to Business Insider's numerous requests to comment for this story."

“I don’t know Chico Mendes,” Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told journalists on an interview show late Monday night, when asked about the famous Brazilian rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist who was murdered in 1988. 
As environment minister, Salles oversees the Instituto Chico Mendes, which is named after the environmental advocate and oversees Brazil’s protected conservation areas. 
Bolsonaro downplayed environmental concerns during his 2018 far-right presidential campaign, threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and advocating more mining and economic development in the Amazon rainforest. 
Salles told interviewers on TV show Roda Viva that he hears contradictory accounts about Mendes’ life, saying environmentalists praise his work while local farmers claim he “used the rubber tappers to advance his own interests.” 
“It is irrelevant. What difference does it make who Chico Mendes is at the moment?” Salles said. 
His comments fueled criticism of the administration’s stance, which environmentalists say is excessively pro-business and farm interests.

Salles also confirmed that he would travel to the Amazon for the first time on Tuesday. 
His press office could not immediately clarify if it was his first visit as minister or his first-ever trip to the region. 
Salles also acknowledged that regulatory “shortcomings” may have led to the rupture of a dam for mining waste owned by Vale SA, which released a wave of mud killing at least 165 people and devastating the Paraobepa river. 
Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, knew last year that the dam had a heightened risk of rupturing, according to an internal document seen by Reuters on Monday. 
In 2015, a similar failure of a nearby tailings dam at a mine co-owned by Vale, also in the state of Minas Gerais, killed 19 people and damaged the Rio Doce river. 
The minister said the government has been wasting technical and financial resources on licensing and oversight for all types of projects, and pledged to introduce policy changes to address the problem.

If so, you could buy the West Bellevue house where in 1994 Jeff Bezos lived and started Amazon. The price is $1.49 million, considered a relative bargain for the neighborhood.
Bezos rented the three-bedroom, one-and-three-quarter bathroom house built in 1954. The attached garage served as the original Amazon headquarters. 
The 1,540-square-foot house is on the market for the first time in 10 years. The listing calls it a slice of history, and gives a future owner the opportunity to own the birthplace of Amazon. 
An affordable, single-story slice of history it is. While West Bellevue is the most expensive neighborhood in the region, according to The Seattle Times, it is below the areas median home price of about $2 million. The lower price may also reflect a softening regional real estate market, where the number of unsold homes has more than double from last year.
Nevertheless, the houses value has climbed considerably in the years since Bezos lived there. The Seattle Times reports that while the house was valued at $135,000 in 1994, it was bought for $182,000 in 1998. In 2009, when the current owners purchased the house, they paid $620,000less than half of its current asking price.
But prospective buyers be warned: the house will not look identical to how it did when Bezos made it his residence. In 2001, the house was reportedly extensively remodeled, including installing a new roof and bathroomand the garage was remodeled too. However, it does have the signature oversized mailbox Bezos installed."

real kerfuffle,"(Bloomberg) -- As Amazon.com Inc. and Google work to place their smart speakers at the center of the internet-connected home, both technology giants are expanding the amount of data they gather about customers who use their voice software to control other gadgets.
For several years, Amazon and Google have collected data every time someone used a smart speaker to turn on a light or lock a door. Now they’re asking smart-home gadget makers such as Logitech and Hunter Fan Co. to send a continuous stream of information.
In other words, after you connect a light fixture to Alexa, Amazon wants to know every time the light is turned on or off, regardless of whether you asked Alexa to toggle the switch. Televisions must report the channel they’re set to. Smart locks must keep the company apprised whether or not the front door bolt is engaged.
This information may seem mundane compared with smartphone geolocation software that follows you around or the trove of personal data Facebook Inc. vacuums up based on your activity. But even gadgets as simple as light bulbs could enable tech companies to fill in blanks about their customers and use the data for marketing purposes. Having already amassed a digital record of activity in public spaces, critics say, tech companies are now bent on establishing a beachhead in the home.
“You can learn the behaviors of a household based on their patterns,” says Brad Russell, who tracks smart home products for researcher Parks Associates Inc. “One of the most foundational things is occupancy. There’s a lot they could do with that.”
Some device makers are pushing back, saying automatic device updates don’t give users enough control over what data they share, or how it can be used. Public guidelines published by Amazon and Google don’t appear to set limits on what the companies can do with the information they glean about how people use appliances.
Amazon and Google say they collect the data to make it easier for people to manage their home electronics. Automatic status updates reduce the time it takes to process voice commands and lets smart-home hubs present up-to-date information on a screen or smartphone app. Greater awareness of what’s going on also lets them proactively suggest helpful uses for their voice assistants, and develop new ones.
Smart speakers are among the fastest growing categories of consumer electronics, led by Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices. That’s pushed the companies and their Alexa and Assistant software deeper into debates about the tradeoffs between useful services and the harvesting of personal data. Both have had public pratfalls around privacy of voice commands, either recording private messages in error or sending them to others.
The commercial success of voice assistants has bolstered dozens of companies working to build interest in internet-enabled televisions, kitchen appliances and other devices. Many people first start tinkering with connected appliances after buying a smart speaker. Surveys show about a quarter of U.S. smart speaker owners regularly use them to control something else, a percentage analysts expect to rise.
When smart speakers first hit the market, using them to command another device worked like this. After receiving the command “Alexa, turn on the light,” the software would ask the light bulb maker’s servers for the current status of the bulb. After a reply came back confirming the switch was off, Alexa would instruct the light to turn on.
Now, in a push that accelerated last year, Amazon and Google are recommending—and, in some cases, requiring—that smart home makers tweak their code to reverse that relationship. Instead, the light bulb must report in to the hub with its status at all times.
“Oversharing for the sake of oversharing is probably never a good thing,” says Ian Crowe, a senior director with Logitech International S.A., a builder of computer and home electronics accessories. “We should have a good reason, and our users should agree it’s a good reason,” before sharing data.
Logitech has tried to meet Amazon and Google halfway. Rather than tell smart speakers what each device connected to Logitech's Harmony remote controls were doing, Crowe says Logitech reports back with broad descriptions, specifying that a user is watching television instead of passing on information about their choice of channel, for instance.
“There are very relevant concerns about how much the system knows,” he says.
Crowe says Logitech has had conversations about status reporting with Amazon and Google, but declined to detail them. Executives at two other smart device makers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships, say they’ve asked for concessions from Amazon and Google related to user privacy or transparency and guarantees about use of the data, but been rebuffed.
An Amazon spokesman says the company doesn’t sell user data and doesn’t use information it gets from status reports for advertising. Status reports, he says, are designed to enable useful features for customers. He declined to comment on how long Amazon stores the data. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the company’s implementation of status updates.
Russell, the analyst with Parks Associates, calls status reporting “a bit of a Trojan Horse request.” Amazon and Google, he says, are suggesting “‘Hey, help us help you by giving us the status of your device, and make everyone’s life easier.’ But what they’re not saying is, ‘Gee, we can do a lot with that data.”
Even light fixtures, in elaborate setups, are a map of home life: When do you get home? When does the light in your child’s bedroom usually go off? What days do you burn the midnight oil?
Still, the nascent smart-home market is fiercely contested, and some critics acknowledge their worries about data collection are partly motivated by concerns that Amazon and Google will use their central position to muscle out rivals and dictate terms to the rest of the market. Moreover, some other smart-home companies themselves gather status reports, though they lack the scale or billion-dollar advertising businesses of the tech giants.
Meanwhile, plenty of companies say they are on-board with status reporting. Matt McPherson, an engineering manager with Hunter Fan Co., says that before the advent of status reports, device sometimes shut down without answering the user's command. “Do I think these guys are intentionally grabbing data in order to find some way of advertising?” he asks. “At this moment I don’t think so, but I can see something of that nature happening in the future.”

Measles surges again as it finds a weak spot: Anti-vax parents
If a disease were striking children, causing rash and fever and sometimes escalating to brain swelling, pneumonia and even death, there would be a public demand to do something about it.
America did, and measles was declared eradicated here in 2000.
Now the malady is back in Illinois and at least nine other states, with two cases in downstate Champaign and an alarming breakout in the Pacific Northwest, where the governor of Washington has declared a state of emergency.
Blame a stubbornly resistant anti-vaccine movement driven by dangerous pseudoscience and the worst impulses of obsessive overparenting. ""I know what's best for my child!"" anti-vax parents say, and measles spreads.
The World Health Organization warned Thursday of a dramatic rise in measles cases globally as parents reject vaccines for their children. In Europe, measles cases reached their highest level in a decade in 2018. Outbreaks have hit the Philippines and Madagascar. In a world of global travel, these aren't distant concerns. A monthslong series of cases in New York has been traced to an unvaccinated child who caught the disease on a trip to Israel.
Measles can cause lifelong effects including deafness. It is ugly, with its blotchy, fevered spots, some of which leave permanent scars. It's highly contagious and miserable to experience.
A worried anti-vaccinations parent posted on Facebook to ask whether there were any precautions she could take to protect her 3-year-old from a measles outbreak. Ah yes, if only there were a way. She was rightly given a social media spanking.
Measles vaccine is 97 percent effective after two doses, which usually also protect against mumps, rubella and sometimes varicella, or chickenpox, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A well-vaccinated population takes on a ""herd immunity"" that hinders outbreaks. Some states, including Washington, allow parents wide latitude in skipping the vaccine. The Washington legislature is now rethinking that.
""Thankfully, we live in a highly immunized community,"" Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, told the local News-Gazette. ""That's why it doesn't go wild like a brush fire.""
Watching plump, pure baby flesh pierced and feeling trepidation about how the child's system will react can be legitimately nerve-wracking for a parent. That's no license to avoid a medical necessity that protects child and community. The right to resist comes with a corresponding responsibility to back up that impulse with rigorous research.
Once more: Both studies that purported to find a link between vaccines and autism have been thoroughly discredited. There is no evidence connecting the two.
Seeking a second opinion may sometimes be wise. Opting out of sound medicine and public health policy in favor of conspiracy theories is not.
""All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunization should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible,"" children's author Roald Dahl wrote in a 1980s essay promoting vaccination. His daughter Olivia, to whom he dedicated ""James and the Giant Peach,"" died of measles-induced encephalitis at age 7.
Dahl was onto something. Illinois is among states that allow ""mature minors"" a voice in their own medical care. Children of anti-vax parents are visiting websites like Reddit to seek advice on how to get vaccines all by themselves.
Now that's some healthy skepticism of unwise parenting.

Illinois is betting big that gambling is an unadulterated good.
Change is coming to Illinois a higher minimum wage first, soon to be followed by the legalization of marijuana.
Then there is sports gambling, which is an option due to a ruling last year by the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition to action in many of the 50 states, federal legislation may be forthcoming.
Illinois, of course, is already up to its neck in legalized gambling that includes casinos, video gambling, the lottery and race tracks. Those activities generate substantial income, but not as much as some predicted. Further, it seems that placing video-gambling parlors on virtually every street corner is diminishing the amount of gambling that once was done at the state's 10 casinos.
Sports betting would be a whole new wrinkle on the gambling front, a government-overseen entertainment that would replace an illegal underground marketplace.
A recent study indicates that legalized gambling in Illinois would generate $12 billion in wagers, create 2,500 jobs and generate up to $100 million in tax revenue.
The authors of the study have their reasons for making that assessment.
But one ought to be careful about embracing predictions on a practice that is still a gleam in the eye of the revenue-hungry Gov. J.B. Pritzker and members of the General Assembly.
Further, it's important not to get caught up in the rush to pass legislation.
Ever since the Supreme Court ruling, gambling hustlers have been urging legislators in Illinois and other states to be among the first to pass legislation allowing sports gambling.
The theory is that those who strike first will reap the largest rewards.
There is merit to swift action, but not at the expense of making careful and thoughtful decisions about what's to be done.
Legislation authorizing casino gambling was rushed to passage, as was that creating the video-gambling frenzy. In retrospect, it looks as though state officials would have been better served to adopt a more deliberate and careful approach.
Instead, they acted in haste, and, as various reports have suggested, now repent in leisure.
The state has, historically, had a hard time passing gambling legislation because it turns into a scrum of conflicting interests, all of whom are looking to get rich at the others' expense.
Further, those who gained gambling privileges in one round of legislation take the casino owners vigorously resist proposals for new venues that would compete with their existing venues.
Does anyone think that the owners of casinos in Joliet and Des Plaines want to see another casino or two or three in Chicago? Absolutely not, and they're willing to spread plenty of money around in campaign donations or other forms of remuneration to see that it doesn't happen.
Adding sports betting to the gambling field ensures a major conflagration. But the impending battle will be less about the specifics of operations than it will be about who makes the big money from this new business.
Illinois is a huge state that has the capacity to make sports-book owners a whole lot of money. But which ones will it be? And what will the cost of the entry fee for those competing for the privilege of taking gamblers' money?
Ten states already have legalized sports gambling, none of them in the Midwest.
If Illinois follows, it will be a game-changer in terms of social mores, one not necessarily for the better. People will just have to wait and see what follows.
But don't buy the hype that another expansion of gambling will represent some kind of financial panacea for our financially challenged state.
Legal gambling generates revenue, but it also generates costs, including a fraying of the social fabric of society. After all, everyone can't be a winner.

(Decatur) Herald &amp; Review
We support legalizing marijuana. Here are the hurdles we see.
The climate is right.
High on the list of changes planned by Gov. J.B. Pritzker is the state-wide legalization of recreational marijuana. The timing for this legislation is even more favorable now than before the election.
Legalizing marijuana has been tried and tested by states before Illinois. There are substantial benefits that could help the state navigate budget problems and funding issues. It has the potential to infuse revenue at the ground level, as the retail market develops and helps stimulate the local economy. It has a proven record of reducing the impact of the opioid epidemic.
In November, the Illinois Economic Policy Institute published ""The Financial Impact of Legalizing Marijuana in Illinois."" The report noted taxation and regulation of marijuana in Illinois could create nearly 24,000 new jobs. Legalization would boost the state's economy by $1 billion per year and generate in excess of $500 million in new state and local tax revenue.
One of the most compelling reasons to move forward with legislation is the impact it has on the opioid crisis. According to the Center for Disease Control, deaths attributed to opioid overdose totaled 70,237 nationwide in 2017. In Illinois, there were 2,778 in 2017, which followed 2,411 in 2016 and 1,835 in 2015. In states that have already legalized marijuana for recreation, the number of opioid deaths is dropping. In some states, fatalities have fallen as much as 33 percent. It's a number we have to take seriously.
The climate is right in Illinois to take the next step in marijuana legalization, but that alone doesn't warrant charging ahead blindly. With other states having gone before us, there is no excuse for not moving methodically and purposefully in preparing to make this significant change. There is time to do it right.
Though Gov. Pritzker has made it clear that revenue through taxes is a priority, the predominance of the plan seems to focus on creating opportunities for minority businesses and benefits to communities affected by drug crime. There does not seem to be, however, a thorough analysis pondering through what system that revenue stream is built. If economics is one of the key reasons justifying legalization, that's a question that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.
The process of legalizing a once illegal substance is challenging. It does not just involve taxes and licenses. It requires a transition from a pre-legal state to a post-legal one. Going from a high demand-high cost product with minimal market infrastructure to a lower demand-lower cost product once the market develops and stabilizes.
Colorado gained initial revenue simply by being a pioneer in legalization. As the market stabilized, production costs came down, reducing the tax revenue with it. California, meanwhile, taxes both by weight and by prices, leaving at least part of the revenue not dependent upon supply or increased demand to drive tax revenue up.
As a state, we're closer than we've ever been to legalized recreational marijuana. There are plenty of reasons to proceed, and plenty of reasons we should answer some important implementation questions before we finalize it.

Museum officials said Monday that the old Walmart Neighborhood Market will begin housing its staff, art classes and children's theater rehearsals in September. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the move comes about a month before crews are scheduled to break ground on the center's more than two-year renovation project.
The museum's nonprofit foundation didn't disclose the lease terms.
The museum's interim executive director, Laine Harber, says the deal allows the center to keep staff employed, maintain daily programming and continue museum school classes for its roughly 3,000 students.

That's mostly because WiFi extenders have their own network name that's slightly different to your main WiFi network's name. For example, an extender's network name might be your main network's name with the letters ""EXT"" tagged on, to indicate that it's your extender's WiFi network. 
 Mesh systems like Eero, on the other hand, help your devices automatically switch to the nearest Eero, and each Eero broadcasts the same WiFi network name. 
 Eero will also automatically connect your devices to the appropriate WiFi band — 2.4GHz and 5Ghz — depending on their needs. If your devices need better range, Eero will automatically connect your devices to the longer-range 2.4GHz band. If you're close enough to an Eero router, it'll connect your devices to the 5GHz band, which offers faster speeds, but has less range than the 2.4GHz band. 
 To be fair, some recent extenders give options to keep your main WiFi network's name and bands to make switching easier and automatic. At the same time, you might need to go into the extender's settings to enable that feature, which can be complicated for a lot of users."

Many investors have been uncertain about the prospects of the markets this year. Some are bracing for the bull rally to continue running while others are preparing for stocks to fall the other way. Earlier last month, Powell said the central bank would keep an eye on economic growth throughout the year and adjust monetary policy if growth slows.

Rometty also announced that IBM would open its Watson artificial intelligence service to all cloud platforms, not just IBM's cloud. The move will give IBM customers capability to manage and run data under the clouds run by providers like Microsoft and Amazon.
""Watson can run on your premise it can run on any cloud and it can connect between them,"" Rometty said. ""This is a big piece not just of Watson a big piece of hybrid cloud,"" she said, referring to the idea of mixing on-premises software with services from multiple cloud providers.

 Rather than focus on so-called digital native companies — largely startups that began their lives in the cloud — Google Cloud is going to go after established companies in established industries like retail or finance. 
 ""Historically, people have thought Google has a strong presence in the digital native community,"" Kurian said onstage. ""Over the last 12 months, we've shifted our strategy to go after more traditional industries...You will see us continue to focus our go-to-market effort in going after the largest customers."" 
 Kurian's remarks — his first since replacing Diane Greene as CEO in January— came at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on Tuesday. Kurian came to Google following a long career at Oracle. 
 Kurian says that he plans to ""significantly"" expand Google Cloud's sales teams, and train them to target traditional industries like retail, manufacturing, automotive, finance, and others. 
 ""We're going to specialize our sales team to talk to specific industries in the language of the industry,"" Kurian said. ""You will see us competing much more aggressively going forward,"" he continued. 
 Similarly, Kurian plans on expanding Google Cloud's customer support teams — potentially fixing a major customer complaint with the platform. 
 ""In order to serve a large corporation well, it's important for those organizations to have a person to talk to,"" Kurian said.

 More broadly, Kurian says, Google Cloud is taking a new philisophy called ""Customers for Life."" This involves not only acquiring and retaining customers, but converting them into advocates for Google Cloud. 
 Right now, Google Cloud is considered the number 3 cloud on the market, lagging behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Analysts say Google needs to step up its ability to sell into the largest customers. Kurian's gameplan here could help plug that gap and make it more competitive, as he inherits 
 At the same time, though, Kurian says that customers believe that Google Cloud has come a long way — and that it still has a competitive edge. 
 ""I talked to the largest customers and asked, 'Why did you choose Google?' Kurian said. ""Uniformly, the feedback I got was, 'It's by far the best technology in the market.'"" 
 Meanwhile, Google Cloud is already working to acquire prominent customers.
