In the interview, Razek, the 70-year-old chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, said that he didn't think the lingerie brand's annual fashion show should feature \"transsexuals\" because \"the show is a fantasy.\"   Business Insider spoke to four former Victoria's Secret executives who held longtime positions at the company but wished to remain anonymous in order to speak frankly about their time there. Three of these executives were based in the New York office. The fourth requested full anonymity.   These former employees said that based on their experience working there, there is no real debate as to whether Razek would have stepped down. They said that he has full control over the creative vision of the brand and is considered to be the closest confidant of Les Wexner, CEO and founder of parent company L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works and Pink in addition to Victoria's Secret.   Former executives said that in their experience, Razek and Wexner had an \"unshakable\" view of how the company's image should be projected and were extremely resistant to change. And, ultimately, this attitude could be responsible for the brand's current sales slump.  Kendall Jenner at Victoria's Secret 2018 runway show.  Razek joined the company in 1983 as vice president of marketing for Limited Stores. In 1993, he became vice president, director of marketing for Limited, Inc., working directly with Wexner across all of the parent company's retail businesses, including Victoria's Secret. L Brands acquired the lingerie brand in 1982.   Razek has been responsible for organizing Victoria's Secret annual fashion show since 1995 and became chief marketing officer of L Brands in the late 1990s, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.   Both Wexner and Razek work in the company's head office in Columbus, Ohio. The former executives who spoke with Business Insider interacted with the two men in regular conference calls, meetings, and during visits to the Columbus office.   \"Ed ... is just very untouchable in Les' eyes,\" a former executive who worked at Victoria's Secret's New York office for nine years and was laid off in mid-2017 told Business Insider.   \"He considers Ed to be like a brainchild of the brand with him,\" they continued. \"He is the golden child and does whatever he wants.\"   The Wexner/Razek duo has undoubtedly been successful. Victoria's Secret dominated the US lingerie market for years, and Razek was considered one of the most influential people in modeling throughout the early 2000s, helping to launch the careers of household names such as Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Tyra Banks, and Heidi Klum.   The former executives who spoke with Business Insider said that working at Victoria's Secret was considered to be the job in lingerie, and there was always a feeling that they were very lucky to be there.   But as the industry evolved, critics say that Victoria's Secret did not, and according to these former executives, who cited experiences they had while working there, it's because these two men were resistant to changing things.  The idea of the Victoria's Secret \"Angel\" came into play in 1997 after a commercial featuring Helena Christensen, Karen Mulder, Daniela Petov\u00e1, Stephanie Seymour, and Tyra Banks ran to promote its \"Angels\" underwear collection.  These two men have a specific view of what makes a woman sexy, another former employee who worked in a senior management role at Victoria's Secret for over a decade and was also made redundant, told Business Insider.   \"[They] have an unshakable point of view as to how that brand should be projected,\" this former executive said. \"They don't want it to change.\"   This has also made it difficult for other company leaders to make their mark, these former executives said, which could be why there has been frequent turnover within the company's management team.   When Sharen Turney, the longtime CEO of Victoria's Secret, left abruptly in 2016, the business was split into three\u2014 Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty, and Pink \u2014 and each division had its own CEO. The most recent CEO of Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Jan Singer, stepped down after two years in the role in November and was replaced by John Mehas, former president of Tory Burch.   Pink CEO Denise Landman retired at the end of last year and has been replaced by Amy Hauk, former head of merchandising and product development at Bath & Body Works.   \"There was an understanding that Les Wexner was the founder and it is his company; he is the biggest shareholder,\" another former longtime executive told Business Insider. \"I think that is why there is new leadership every three years because people are hopeful that they have more of a say than they do.\"   Other company leaders were often blamed for sales problems when a lot of it was due to the vision of the brand not being current, this former executive said, adding: \"The vision of perfection is owned by Ed and Les.\"   Earlier this month, the CEO of Barington Capital Group, which is a shareholder in L Brands, wrote a fiery letter to Wexner urging him to, among other things, update the brand's image and switch up its predominantly male board of directors.   Barington CEO James A. Mitarotonda called out the lack of diversity on L Brands' board and said that since the majority of the board also has ties to the Wexner family, they could not be seen as truly \"independent\" voices.   \"The existence of these social and business relationships raises serious questions as to the true independence of these directors,\" the letter said.   Barington recommended that Wexner not only switch up the board, but also step down from his dual role of both chairman and CEO to take on just one of those positions.   Razek was also called out in the shareholder letter.   \"In our view, Mr. Razek has done a poor job of stewarding Victoria's Secret's brand by failing to communicate a compelling, up-to-date image that resonates with today's consumers,\" Mitarotonda wrote.   He added: \"While we recognize that Victoria's Secret cannot be all things to all people, we believe that the Company should be delivering a more inclusive marketing message that promotes a more expansive view of beauty.\"   Mitarotonda referenced the success of American Eagle's Aerie brand, which recently reported its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Starting in 2014, the brand has swapped out airbrushed ads for unretouched photos and launched a body-positive campaign known as #AerieReal.  My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive. I apologize. To be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show. We've had transgender models come to castings And like many others, they didn't make itBut it was never about gender. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.  Jeremy Robinson-Leon, a crisis management expert at Group Gordon, told Business Insider that there is precedent for leaders stepping down after making similarly controversial remarks.   Robinson-Leon said that a company's decision to ask an executive or someone who is a voice of the brand to step down in these situations often depends on how seriously it is treating the issue.   This adds weight to the recent criticism that Victoria's Secret is behind the times, according to Robinson-Leon.   \"Any person who makes a statement like that does not have a place in 2019,\" he said.   But there's no cut-and-dry solution here. The late Karl Lagerfeld, for example, was known for making controversial remarks and keeping his job.   Lululemon founder Chip Wilson famously made remarks about the brand's leggings not being suitable for larger women after customers complained that the material was pilling in 2013. A month after this interview, Wilson resigned as chairman but stayed on as a member of the board of directors. He left the company altogether two years after that.   Former Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries is another example of this. In 2013, a 2006 interview in which Jeffries said that the brand goes after \"attractive\" and \"cool\" kids resurfaced and caused controversy.   \"A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong,\" he said.   Jefferies was stripped of his role as chairman of Abercrombie's board of directors in January 2014. He stepped down as CEO at the end of that year.   The fact that Razek didn't leave \"speaks to the core of the company,\" Gabriella Santaniello, analyst and founder of retail research firm A Line Partners, told Business Insider. A Line Partners provides in-depth information on brands to investors. Santaniello has worked in the retail consultancy field for over 10 years.   \"It just reaffirms what everyone has been thinking: they are out of touch,\" she said.\"It has shown up in their sales for years.\"   Same-store sales at Victoria's Secret have dropped for the past three years, and last month, the brand announced it would be closing as many as 53 stores this year, citing a \"decline in performance.\" It projected that its square footage in North America would decline by about 3%.   Santaniello said that the company's woes stem from having Wexner at the helm.   \"He needs to retire,\" she said.   Wexner is often considered one of the most successful businessmen in the US. He is worth more than $6.3 billion and has worked his way up from running a small store in downtown Columbus to owning and founding L Brands, one of the largest retail corporations in the US.   However, he's also the longest standing CEO of any Fortune 500 company.   In a rare interview with the Financial Times last year, Wexner said that the typical lifespan of a fashion business is 15 years. He's been at the helm of L Brands for 56 years.   But, some of Victoria's Secret's critics say this is exactly what the brand has failed to do.   \"The sad part about the brand is that they have this beautiful heritage, they created the angels, they made the whole supermodel explosion and there is a rich history, but they don't know how to evolve the brand to what is happening to us as a culture,\" the former executive who worked at Victoria's Secret for nine years said.   \"I think that will be the death of them in the end,\" he said.

And now, it\u2019s facing the wrath of two major shareholders. In a letter to the GameStop board, Permit Capital Enterprise Fund and Hestia Capital Partners, which together own 1.3% of GameStop, said that the company needs to replace its \u201cstale board\u201d and increase stock buybacks to return more value to shareholders, according to The Wall Street Journal, which obtained a copy of the letter. They shared concerns that GameStop isn\u2019t doing enough to compete in the hotly contested retail market. Surveying the last five years, we struggle to identify any significant steps the company has takenbesides the introduction of collectiblesto adapt to disruptive dynamics in its core business,\u201d the investors wrote, according to the Journal. GameStop has found itself in increasingly troubled waters. Video game players, which have historically been the lifeblood of GameStop\u2019s business, now have many more places to buy games and are increasingly turning to digital copies they can buy on consoles, cutting GameStop out of the purchasing equation. Even among players who buy physical game copies and hardware, online retailers like Amazon and others continue to be a drag on GameStop\u2019s business. In response, GameStop has transitioned its business to add more collectibles, used cell phones, and other products to its stores. In its last fiscal quarter ended November, GameStop sales rose nearly 5% to $2 billion, but its losses widened to $488.6 million. While those issues have been enough to scare investors, GameStop also sought potential suitors last year. The company\u2019s executives ultimately abandoned the plan after announcing that no suitable buyers for GameStop\u2019s business had come along. In their letter, Permit Capital Enterprise Fund and Hestia Capital Partners called GameStop\u2019s inability to find a buyer \u201ca failure.\u201d They added that it\u2019s illustrative that \u201cchange is needed.\u201d The investors have until March 28 to nominate new directors to the GameStop board.

In the UK, House of Fraser and HMV were each sold for a song. The insolvencies are striking up and down the value chain, from designer BCBG Max Azria to discount shop Poundworld. With these failures came job losses and further pressure on malls and high streets as shoppers had fewer reasons to visit. Yet with adversity comes opportunity. Whenever a sector is under pressure, it gives those with creative solutions a chance to shine. Amazon emerged stronger from the 2001 dotcom bust, and decades earlier the big three US carmakers ultimately improved their offerings when their dominance was challenged by better-made Japanese imports. There is some hope that we may be seeing that kind of resurgence today. So many of the strongest candidates for this year\u2019s Boldness in Business awards were retailers that one of the judges was moved to observe that we might be seeing a \u201cretail renaissance\u201d. The winners impressed us with how they have responded to everything from supply chain challenges to environmental degradation. Two of our winners emerged from the groceries sector, which has been hit especially hard by changing shopping habits, concerns about waste and squeezed margins. Amazon\u2019s entry into the sector, as well as the spread of discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi, have put pressure on supermarket groups to cut costs and improve convenience. Ocado, the UK online grocer and winner of the technology category, has been around for 19 years. But it has come into its own in the past two years, winning contracts to set up robotic warehouses and e-delivery services for competitors, including Wm Morrison in the UK, Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and Kroger in the US. Under the deals, Ocado will roll out the robotic technology it developed for its own business to improve the online services of other retailers. In other words, it has created a bright spot in the general retail gloom by helping less technologically advanced companies adapt to the shift to online shopping that is damaging so many of its competitors. The other winner from the grocery sector, Iceland Foods, took the corporate responsibility/environment prize for its efforts to fight plastic waste and the environmental degradation associated with the use of palm oil. Based in the UK, Iceland focuses on value and frozen food. It has long sought to woo customers concerned about health and the environment \u2014 during the 1980s it was the first big UK supermarket to remove artificial colourings and non-essential preservatives from food and to ban genetically modified food. For this year\u2019s awards, it caught the judges\u2019 eye for its #TooCoolForPlastic campaign to replace all plastic in its own-brand packaging within five years. It has stopped offering single-use bags, removed plastic from 85 per cent of packaging, including egg cartons, and trialled reverse vending machines that give customers a 10p voucher for each empty plastic bottle they put in. The campaigns have helped this relatively small player stand out \u2014 like-for-like sales rose 2 per cent in the last reporting period and Iceland was named the UK\u2019s top supermarket for customer service for the second year in a row, scoring highly for \u201cemotional connection\u201d and \u201cethics\u201d. The results suggest retailers can prosper in competitive markets when they offer shoppers a real reason to buy there. The final retailer to win in this year\u2019s competition, Fast Retailing, took the prize in the \u201cDrivers of change\u201d category. Owner of the Uniqlo, Theory, J Brand and Comptoir des Cotonniers brands, Fast Retailing is the world\u2019s third-largest seller of casual fashion, behind Zara, owned by Inditex of Spain, and H&M of Sweden. Unlike those fast-fashion chains, which restock daily and have been criticised for encouraging waste, Fast Retailing offers fewer but more classic pieces \u2014 ones that are designed to last several seasons but are affordable because of the company\u2019s efforts to keep costs down. One of the first Japanese retail groups to go global, Fast Retailing is now leading the way in automation. It has set a target for annual revenue of \u00a53tn ($27bn) by 2022, up from the \u00a52.3tn projected for 2019. Ocado, Iceland and Fast Retailing are all well positioned to appeal to millennial customers, who do proportionally more online shopping and place greater emphasis on wanting\u00a0corporate values that reflect their own.

But experts say that wouldn't be enough to stave off a deceleration in growth in the largest economies. \u00a0The effects of tariffs are expected to outlast the trade war.\u00a0 Even if the US and China reach an agreement to end a trade war that has cast uncertainty on financial markets and consumers over the past year, the largest economies are still set to slow in coming months.  \"We don't expect the deal to have a major impact on the economy,\" said Andrew Hunter, a senior economist at Capital Economics.  Government data released Thursday showed industrial output in China sank to its lowest point in 17 years, the latest in a wave of dismal economic results out there over the last year. Even as Chinese officials roll out stimulus measures left and right, some still see the possibility of a hard landing ahead.  In the US, a growing number of key indicators have similarly pointed to slowing activity as the effects of tax cuts and other stimulus measures fade.\u00a0 Economic growth forecasts for the beginning of the year have been steadily falling, especially following surprisingly soft retail sales and employment reports out this month. Nearly half of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this month think the US will enter a recession by 2020. Hunter sees reported commitments made in negotiations, including reducing the US-China trade deficit, as unlikely to add up to much in the short term.  There may be some scope to increase exports of goods like aircraft and motor vehicles, he said, but agricultural or energy commodities are clearly subject to greater supply constraints. Global trade relationships have also shifted since last year, so any major production changes would take time.  It's unclear if or when duties will be removed. With little evidence of progress on structural issues, Trump told reporters this week that he was in \"no rush\" to make a deal with China. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appears likely to take place in April.  The worst may be yet to come in the trade war, according to Li Zeng, an economist at UBS. Chinese exports mostly held up through the end of 2018, but that could change as frontloading wanes and as businesses relocate production to other countries.  \"This year, however, while the positive progress in the trade talks has given the market sentiment a big boost, we expect the real damage from the trade war to continue to manifest \u00a0itself,\" Zeng said.

Known for selling wicker chairs and scented candles, Pier 1 has suffered financial losses amid an increasingly competitive retail landscape dominated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc.  Pier 1, which has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada, has added debt restructuring specialists at Kirkland & Ellis LLP to a roster of advisers counseling the chain as it explores strategic alternatives, the sources said.  Pier 1 is also taking meetings with investment bankers who have debt restructuring expertise as it weighs options, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the company\u2019s deliberations are confidential. As of December, the company had about $200 million in long-term debt. Pier 1 has a market capitalization of $90 million.  The engagement of Kirkland & Ellis restructuring lawyers, who typically work on significant bankruptcies and other financial workouts, marks a new chapter in Pier 1\u2019s turnaround efforts after previous initiatives failed to bear fruit.  However, a bankruptcy filing is not yet on the horizon for Pier 1, which had about $71 million in cash as of December and $400 million available from a revolving credit line, one of the sources said. The company\u2019s debt begins coming due in 2021, and it is cutting spending.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based company in December said it hired Credit Suisse to advise on a \u201cfull range\u201d of strategic alternatives and that its chief executive had stepped down. The company acknowledged that a transformation plan it had dubbed \u201cA New Day,\u201d unveiled last year, failed to deliver results fast enough.  Pier 1\u2019s $200 million term loan coming due in 2021 is currently trading at about 50 cents on the dollar, according to data from financial services provider Refinitiv, indicating that investors are concerned about the company\u2019s prospects. Lenders holding the debt have organized and tapped their own advisers, the people familiar with the matter said, a move that often presages restructuring negotiations between a company and its creditors.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc in December said Pier 1\u2019s outlook was negative because of the chain\u2019s weak operating performance and uncertainty over whether it would be able to turn around its business. Pier 1\u2019s well-known brand may help it, though, the ratings agency said.  The downturn for retailers has led to high-profile bankruptcies including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. In the recent rout, furniture chains like Pier 1 have so far been insulated from the upheaval.

(Evan Vucci/AP) THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Over the vocal objections of the Trump administration, the Senate voted 54 to 46 yesterday to cut off U.S. support for the vicious, Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The invocation of the War Powers Act will soon be taken up in the House, where it has more than enough support to pass. Later today, the Senate is poised to pass the resolution of disapproval that rebukes President Trumps national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It has already advanced through the House. Seven Senate Republicans broke ranks on Yemen, and the White House now expects between 10 to 12 GOP senators will defect on todays wall vote, a senior administration official told my colleague Josh Dawsey last night. Coming from a Senate thats proved\u00a0so pliant to Trumps whims over the past two years, the back-to-back votes are significant and could foreshadow more resistance or independence to come. Trump has promised he will veto both bills. These would be his first vetoes since taking office. Though neither the House nor the Senate has the two-thirds necessary to override him on either one, the resolution of disapproval will provide fodder for lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the emergency declaration in courts. The one-two punch gets at the very heart of the separation of powers. Declaring war and spending money are bedrock powers assigned to Congress in the Constitution, but the legislative branch has abdicated both over time to what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called the imperial presidency. Trump knows hes going to lose on the floor today, aides say, but hes trying to wrangle enough votes so that hes not embarrassed by a lopsided final count. To lock down the support of Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for example, the administration promised that money for the wall wont be diverted from Arizona military construction projects. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) confer on Wednesday after the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) -- Senate Republicans tried to give Trump an off-ramp to defuse what could be described as a constitutional crisis, but the president wouldnt take it. The president rejected a compromise plan put forward by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which would have allowed him to score a victory on the disapproval vote, because he did not want to foreclose the possibility of using emergency powers again in the future to advance policy objectives that Congress does not support. Indeed, if he gets away with this emergency, it seems like a pretty safe bet hell be emboldened to try it again as will future Democratic presidents. Were standing on a slippery slope. Trump called Lee to express his opposition as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol. Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues, Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. Many Senate Republicans had started to align behind Lees measure, which would amend the National Emergencies Act to say an emergency declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to keep it. The goal is to give Congress the authority to approve a national emergency declaration not to disapprove it, as is currently the case in law. If it had become law, Lees bill could have affected Trumps national border emergency in the future, since ongoing national emergency declarations must be reaffirmed annually. And it would have affected future national emergencies declared by Trump, as well as by other presidents. Lee also sponsored the Yemen resolution with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagans solicitor general, and he clerked for Sam Alito when the future justice sat on the Third Circuit. The 47-year-old defeated an incumbent GOP senator in 2010 by promising Utahans that hed stand up to presidents in both parties. Congress is supposed to be the first among the federal governments three co-equal branches, Lee said in a statement. For decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch. -- On the national emergency vote, weve got a running whip count on our website. Kate Rabinowitz has compiled what every Republican senator has said about Trumps declaration. There are five hard yes votes on the resolution disapproval: Lee, Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). Tillis and Collins are considered two of the most vulnerable incumbents up for reelection next year. Six senators have publicly expressed concerns about the declaration: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Pat Toomey (Pa.). -- Twenty defections would be needed to override the veto, as Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Pence can cast a tiebreaking vote. No one thinks that will happen. -- The failure to make a deal with conservatives who wanted to find a way out is another indication of Pences limited juice. He cant effectively speak for Trump when hes on the Hill, and hes not empowered to negotiate the way Joe Biden was, partly because hes been undercut so many times by POTUS. There was an effort, numerous efforts, to engage with the vice president and the president, said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). But the president is not persuaded. I dont know of any president that likes to give up power. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) talks with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) before the State of the Union last month. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) -- Trump has tried to reframe his power grab not as a constitutional question, but as a matter of national security. Republican Senators are overthinking [the] vote on National Emergency, he tweeted yesterday. It is very simply Border Security/No Crime Should not be thought of any other way. -- But a lot of principled conservatives and libertarians dont see it that way. Indeed, todays vote will become a legacy-defining litmus test for many senators who fancy themselves as constitutionalists. Through the legal fiction of an emergency, the old rules that governed America, and ensured some democratic check on executive power, are sidelined, writes National Reviews Michael Brendan Dougherty. I happen to think Congress should fund more-extensive border security, including fencing. But conservatives have to defend the constitutional order that gives government acts the savor of legitimacy. That means Congress must reassert itself. Only scrupulous adherence to constitutional processes will keep the law supreme in America, Fein added. -- James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, doesnt get to vote in the Senate today. But he argued poignantly, and timelessly, in Federalist 58 that Congress having the power of the purse is one of the peoples most important checks on tyranny: This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. -- Beto ORourke is officially running for president.

In a Democratic primary, he will not have the bogeyman of a Trump or a Ted Cruz from which to draw voter energy. He is decidedly not the street fighter many Democrats crave. And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Cruz in last years Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss. ... ORourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color. ...\u00a0The government at all levels is overly represented by white men, he says. Thats part of the problem, and Im a white man. So if I were to run, I think its just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. ...\u00a0I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think thats a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.

(Cindy Boren) -- Following days of resistance,\u00a0the FAA issued an emergency order grounding\u00a0Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets after the agency received new evidence pointing to similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani and Damian Paletta report: Trump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air. As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. ...\u00a0The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash. Both aircraft crashed just minutes after takeoff. Just 12 minutes into its journey to Pangkal Pinang, the Lion Air flight crashed into the sea off the coast of Java. The Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed roughly six minutes after leaving Addis Ababa.\u00a0 Both flights\u00a0struggled to gain altitude. The Lion Air flight failed to gain a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet, limiting the crew's room to gain control before the plane plummeted. Though the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is pending, preliminary data shows that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed.\u00a0 Both planes\u00a0appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing. The Lion Air plane pitched downward more than 24 times before its final plunge, all within its 12-minute journey. Though it is not yet clear what happened in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane also appeared to ascend and descend while accelerating. -- Trump privately disparaged the Boeing 737, which he said\u00a0sucked, before he ordered the grounding.\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa\u00a0and Josh Dawsey report: The president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757 ... which he owns as a personal jet. ... He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt.\u00a0...\u00a0Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was 'psychologically'\u00a0important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. ...\u00a0The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the countrys second-largest federal contractor.\u00a0 Trump should not have been the person making this decision, aviation experts said:\u00a0Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. 'Its not the presidents decision and it should never be the presidents decision,' he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols. -- Trump wanted his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to become the FAA administrator, a position thats remained vacant since Barack Obamas appointee finished his term in January 2018. The absence of an FAA leader has been noticeable amid the Boeing fallout. Following an inquiry from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether Trump is still considering Dunkin for the job, or whether he plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. (Isaac Stanley-Becker) -- Wednesday's order grounds more than 70 U.S. aircraft. The Max 8 planes\u00a0are used by American and Southwest airlines, which have a combined 58 of them in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the planes in its fleet. The software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a planes nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilots inputs. -- After the Ethio\u00adpian crash on Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, something it might have done sooner if not for the government shutdown.\u00a0The company and the FAA had been working to hash out the update but it was delayed because of the longest shutdown in U.S. history and differences of opinion, per the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor: U.S. aviation regulators are expected to mandate the change by the end of April. Matthew Whitaker \"did not deny\" talking to Trump about Cohen, according to a House Democrat. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) -- During a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker did not deny that he and Trump personally discussed the government's case against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, according to\u00a0Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Karoun Demirjian reports: Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District, Nadler said following his meeting with Whitaker on Wednesday, referring to the U.S. attorneys office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Cohen.  According to Nadler, Whitaker did not deny that he had been 'directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.' He also did not deny that he had been 'involved in conversations about the scope' of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Bermans recusal from the Cohen case, Nadler said, and whether subordinate prosecutors at the Southern District of New York 'went too far' pursuing the campaign finance case in which Cohen has implicated Trump. The committees ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), who was present for Wednesdays interview with Whitaker, called Nadlers summary an 'interpretation'\u00a0and 'overreach,' while a Republican staff lawyer also present for the meeting said Whitaker simply could not remember ever conversing with Trump about Cohens case.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesdays meeting was not transcribed, complicating the matter of resolving Nadlers and Collinss diverging interpretations of Whitakers account. But Whitakers non-denials are raising questions among Trumps critics about whether his public testimony was accurate.\u00a0 -- Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of nearly eight years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow: In federal court Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Manafort and his attorneys for repeatedly casting his hard fall from power as collateral damage from the special counsels investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. For Manaforts crimes of illegally lobbying in Ukraine and hiding the proceeds overseas, then encouraging witnesses to lie on his behalf, Jacksons terms added 43 months to the 47 months he received in Alexandria federal court last week for bank and tax fraud. Her total sentence was 73 months in the D.C. case, but Jackson said 30 of those would overlap with the tally in Virginia. Asked if he would pardon Manafort, Trump said, I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. Its not something thats right now on my mind. -- Just minutes after Jackson handed down the sentence, a New York grand jury indicted Manafort on charges of residential mortgage fraud charges that fall outside Trumps pardon power. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: Under the Constitution, presidents have wide authority to pardon, but that power applies only to federal convictions, not state cases. New York State Attorney General Letitia James has urged the legislature to fix what Democrats call a double-jeopardy loophole in state law that could negate New Yorks ability to prosecute anyone pardoned by the president. New York lawmakers were working this week to undo the pardon loophole. The state charges could be challenged in the courts as a violation of double jeopardy protections for defendants, an area in which current New York law may favor Manafort. All told, Manafort will probably wind up serving about 6.5 years. He gets credit for the nine months he's already spent in jail. (Tom Jackman) Adding it up, Trumps allies and advisers have so far racked up more than two-and-a-half-presidential terms in prison time. (Philip Bump) -- A top prosecutor on Bob Muellers team is stepping down from the Justice Department, the latest and maybe biggest clue that the special counsel's investigation might soon wrap up. NPRs Carrie Johnson reports: Andrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts.\u00a0 -- Introducing a new character in this saga: Robert Costello, a\u00a0New York lawyer with connections to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that he could sleep well tonight because he had friends in high places \u00a0though he did not specifically mention a possible pardon from the president,\u00a0CNNs Gloria Borger and Jeremy Herb report: Cohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is utter nonsense. Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani. -- Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) rejected calls from House Republicans for an investigation into whether Cohen lied to Congress during his testimony two weeks ago. The Oversight chairman, however, left open the possibility of further action against Trumps former lawyer if new evidence of perjury is uncovered.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been tapping into a privately maintained database of license plates. (Marlon Correa/The Washington Post) -- Immigration agents have been tapping into a vast and privately maintained database of license plate numbers gathered from vehicles across the nation to track immigrants who may be in the United States\u00a0illegally. Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report: The records the ACLU obtained from the Department of Homeland Security through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on a little-noticed and expanding network of surveillance that has developed over the years and for which there appear to be few legal limitations. Immigration and Customs Enforcements use of some of the information in states including California also appears to skirt limitations that sanctuary cities have placed on police cooperation with the immigration agency, the ACLU said. ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said that agents use the license-plate database as a tool to help in its immigration-enforcement investigations and that it does not use the information to track people who have no connection to ICE investigatory or enforcement activities. -- For its upcoming mission to the moon, NASA is considering using commercial alternatives instead of the long-delayed rocket its been working on for years.

ALQST, a Saudi rights group based in London, said Wednesday that the women are being charged under the countrys Cyber Crime law with offenses related to their activism, including contacting human rights groups. The charges carry sentences of up to five years in prison.\u00a0 -- This sham trial exposes Saudi Arabias disrespect for its citizens, writes Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi activist and scholar and The Washington Posts first Jamal Khashoggi fellow: The women have been subjected to horrific torture and sexual harassment, but in a statement the government claimed the accused were enjoying their full rights. Meanwhile, state-linked social media accounts have already virtually convicted the activists and are asking for the maximum punishment. ... Against this background, Saudi Arabia decided to appoint its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar.

Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz often talks about growing up in a public housing project.\u00a0(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) In 1956, the New York City Housing Authority opened Bayview as a moderate income development, built a block away from Jamaica Bay Superficially, Bayview looked much like any city housing development, a collection of brick towers with balky stainless-steel elevators and hallways of green linoleum floors and glazed, aqua-tiled walls. But Bayview, which Schultzs family moved into in its opening year, was built as a no cash subsidy project, according to city records. That meant that unlike developments subsidized by the federal or state government, Bayview had minimum income requirements for tenants, charged higher rents intended to cover the entire cost of its mortgage, and was built to high standards compared to [federal] projects, according to Affordable Housing in New York, a history of public housing in the city.\u00a0 -- In a speech to Miami Dade College detailing how he would run the government, Schultz vowed that he would not sign bills that arent passed with bipartisan support and said he will nominate only Supreme Court justices who could be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate a naive statement for anyone who has been watching the judicial wars.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders, Schultz said. These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change. He said he would fill his cabinet with Democrats, Republicans and Independents, including a greater share of women than any previous president. He promised to work to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing legislative and congressional districts to preserve one partys power. That process is controlled by the states, not Washington, but Schultz said he would push for independent commissions to draw those districts in the future. -- Big Democratic donors are sending their money to four key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania.

Conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Trump a pathological liar after the president falsely insisted that the judge in Manaforts case cleared him of collusion. Its not rational, because its a lie that no reasonable person would believe, he tweeted. It undermines his credibility. Its self-defeating. Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life? One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But one lie on any subject is never enough for Donald Trump. So he next tells a different lie. Yes, I omitted a word, but to save time. A ridiculous assertion, of coursehe really said Tim Apple instead of Tim Cook of Apple to save **a third of a second**? ridiculous because it was irrelevant to the charges at handnot that there was no proof of collusion, just that whether there was or wasnt was irrelevant to the proceedings at hand. And yet he lies againa blatant lieabout what the judge said in open court. Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this mans condition of mind. To be clear, GOP wins elections when theyre about ideas not when theyre personality contests like Dems & media want. Were clearly better off because of @RealDonaldTrump. His record of accomplishment is why hell win re-election especially when compared to Dems leftward lurch.

But the agency stopped short of the total ban proposed by the Obama administration and pushed by some health groups, instead allowing commercial operators to keep using the chemical so long as they are trained. Alexandra Dunn, assistant administrator of EPAs Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said the agency has determined that methylene chloride a controversial product that major home-improvement retailers, such as Lowes and Home Depot, already have pulled from their shelves presents an unreasonable risk of injury.\"  We answered the call from many affected families, to ensure that no other family experiences the death of someone close to them due to this chemical, Dunn told reporters in a conference call. Wendy Hartley, whose 21 year-old son Kevin died two years ago died while refinishing a bathtub even after being trained in how to apply the paint stripper, said the administrations new rules fall short. I am deeply disappointed that the EPA has decided to weaken its proposed ban on methylene chloride, Hartley said in a statement. Getting this deadly chemical out of consumers hands is a step in the right direction a step that was started by retailers nationwide. Workers who use methylene chloride will now be left unprotected and at risk of health issues or death. I will continue my fight until the EPA does its job.  Hartley, who personally appealed last May to then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to ban the chemical, has now joined with the advocacy groups Safer Chemicals Healthy Families and Vermont Public Interest Research Group in suing EPA in the U.S. District Court in Vermont. The EPA proposed an outright ban on methylene chloride and another lethal solvent, NMP, on Jan. 19, 2017, the day before President Barack Obama left office, saying they posed unreasonable risks to human health. Trump administration officials have repeatedly promised to remove methylene chloride from the market, while remaining silent on the fate of NMP. The regulation EPA finalized Friday reflects a compromise with the Pentagon, which lobbied for a carveout given the militarys widespread use of paint strippers on bases across the globe. Under the Obama administrations proposal, the Defense Department received a 10-year exemption on the grounds of national security. Manufacturers of methylene chloride-based strippers, including the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, have argued that the product was safe as long as those using it had adequate training. But public outrage over the chemicals potential risks has escalated in recent years, as advocates shared their stories with lawmakers and regulators about family members who died from exposure to methylene chloride. A dozen people who specialized in refinishing bathtubs died between 2000 and 2011, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who co-authored the chemical safety law that EPA used to limit methylene chloride, said the agency had failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the bipartisan law.  EPAs action today is a watered-down protection that apparently values industry profits at the expense of public health and safety particularly for the hardworking people who will still be risking their lives with exposure to these deadly products, Udall said. Dunn said that if the agency decides that the chemical cannot be used safely in commercial operations, it could determine that it also poses an unreasonable risk to public health, which could be banning it or restricting its use in some way.  While it could take more than eight months for methylene chlorine to be banned from retail sale to consumers, Dunn added that she expected it to be phased out much sooner than that since many stores have already stopped selling it.

Matt Bevin (R). (Timothy D. Easley/AP) The Trump administration will appear today before a federal judge to defend one of its most consequential and controversial moves on health insurance a green light for states to require their Medicaid enrollees to work or volunteer. And the administrations prospects for success dont look great at this point, considering the judge hearing the oral arguments\u00a0previously called the Department of Health and Human Services arbitrary and capricious for approving work requirements at all. U.S. District Judge Jeb Boasberg, an Obama appointee, will hear two separate but related lawsuits this morning at the federal courthouse in the District. The first is a challenge to Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas, one of just three states that have been allowed to put them into effect so far. The second is a challenge to similar requirements in Kentucky, which Boasberg blocked in June. Expect the arguments to further inflame a passionate debate among lawmakers and health-care advocates about whether the low-income Americans who benefit from the Medicaid program should be required to show that theyve obtained a job or engaged in other approved activities such as volunteering or job training. Whether its legal under federal law for states to impose such requirements is the\u00a0key question at stake here. Opponents of work requirements argue it violates the spirit \u00a0and, in some cases, the text of the Social Security Act, which lays out Medicaid as a medical assistance program. A frontal assault on the objectives of Medicaid is shocking and brazen, Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy for Families USA, told reporters earlier this week. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Medicaid chief Seema Verma claim work requirements are legal because they are aimed at helping people move out of poverty entirely. The agency has approved work requirements for\u00a0seven states that have requested them, although only Arkansas, New Hampshire and Indiana have implemented them so far. Arkansas has become a focal point of the whole debate, as more than 18,000 of the states 234,000 Medicaid enrollees lost coverage last year either for failing to comply with the requirements or for failing to report their compliance to the state. Under the states new rules, beneficiaries lose coverage if they dont meet the requirements for three months within one year. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.)\u00a0speaks on Capitol Hill.\u00a0(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Azar said Tuesday that HHS does not yet have data as to why they fell off the program, when queried about the Arkansas situation by Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.). In a heated exchange, Kennedy asked Azar why President Trumps budget proposal this week backed enacting work requirements nationwide if it had incomplete data about the effects of the policy. Healthier people working is not the same thing as work making people healthier, Kennedy retorted. The evidence in Arkansas of work requirements causing people to fall off Medicaid could make it even harder for HHS to convince\u00a0Boasberg of the validity of\u00a0its position this time around. In his ruling over summer, the judge said the agency didnt adequately assess the impact of work requirements on enrollment overall. At minimum, the Secretary failed to adequately analyze coverage, Boasberg wrote. There are two basic elements to that problem: First, whether the project would cause recipients to lose coverage. Second, whether the project would help promote coverage. The Secretary, however, neglected both. And theres something else that encourages opponents of work requirements. In November, the nonpartisan panel that advises on Medicaid policy sent HHS a letter urging it to pause Arkansass work requirements until it had taken steps to help enrollees comply. The low level of reporting is a strong warning signal that the current process may not be structured in a way that provides individuals an opportunity to succeed, with high stakes for beneficiaries who fail, wrote Penny Thompson, chairman of the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. The policy, a key effort by\u00a0outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, will limit the sale of fruity and kid-friendly flavors of vaping products to stores that prohibit minors or that have adult-only sections, our\u00a0Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. Online sellers of these products will also have to tighten age verification and limit the quantities that are sold. Any companies that violate these rules will be subject to enforcement actions from the agency, which can include\u00a0stripping their products from the market. Gottlieb had detailed a plan similar to the new draft guidance back in November. Gottlieb also moved up by one year the deadline for flavored e-cigarettes to get agency approval to August 2021, Laurie writes. The sales restrictions and new deadline would apply to a vast array of e-cigarette products, including those offered in flavors such as cherry and bubblegum. They would not apply to mint, menthol and tobacco flavors unless those products were being sold in a way that targeted minors because the agency says those products are most often used by adult smokers trying to quit. OOF: The leader of one\u00a0of the country's largest insurers expressed openness this week to\u00a0Medicare-for-all. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said he views the idea as a potentially enormous opportunity for the health insurance industry, Insider Louisville reports. For me, I think its a great opportunity for the industry to be able to expand the population that its coordinating care with, Broussard said Tuesday at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference in Miami Beach, Fla.\u00a0 But Broussard said he would expect a Medicare-for-all plan to still involve the private sector working in conjunction with the federal government to provide care, comparing it to the way the U.S. manages its space program. And\u00a0he warned that there are big, outstanding questions about how such a system would work\u00a0and who would pay for it. Partnership for America's Health Care Future -- the coalition of industry groups opposing all iterations of Medicare-for-all -- pushed back against Broussard's remarks. OUCH: Nearly 100 countries reported\u00a0marked surges in measles cases last year\u00a0over the previous year, according to a new U.N.\u00a0report. The rise was in part due to complacency among parents and unwarranted concerns about vaccination, the report found. Recent measles outbreaks have also led to questions in countries over the ramifications for families unwilling to vaccinate children, even as most countries say that decision is up to the parents, our Post colleague Rick Noack writes. A law that took effect at the beginning of 2016 in the Australian state of Victoria made vaccinations a condition for the enrollment of children in preschool, he reports. Families unwilling to have their children vaccinated were also refused access to family assistance payments, except if kids were ineligible to receive vaccinations because of allergies. In Europe, Italian lawmakers followed suit in 2017, banning children from nurseries if they had not received a total of 10 mandatory vaccinations and imposing fines on parents of unvaccinated school-age kids. In a sign of how politically divisive the issue remains, the populist Five Star Movement later suspended the rule temporarily. When that suspension order expired this week, hundreds of children were denied access to kindergartens across the country. Critics of these sort of measures say its more important to debunk conspiracy theories\u00a0related to vaccines and raise public awareness to their importance. In Finland, for example, there are no mandatory vaccination policies, but efforts such as vaccination in schools and public awareness campaigns have contributed to immunization rates of 95 to 99 percent. In December, officials in the county at the center of New Yorks worst measles outbreak in decades, were compelled to ban unvaccinated children from going to schools that had vaccination rates lower than 95 percent. Months later, the parents of more than 40 of those children sued the Rockland County health department to get their children back in the classroom. But a federal judge\u00a0rejected that request this week. The parents are calling it an exclusion order that has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm, our Post colleague Reis Thebault reports. U.S. District Court Judge Vincent Briccetti said it wasnt in the public interest to let them go back to class. While no one enjoys the fact that these kids are out of school, these orders have worked,\" said county attorney, Thomas Humbach, in a statement to the local Journal News. \"They have helped prevent the measles outbreak from spreading to this school population. The parents lawyer Michael Sussman told the New York Times: What Rockland County has done is remarkably irrational in every conceivable way. Rockland countys effort is the latest effort that exemplifies concern nationwide over the anti-vaccination movement. At the private Green Meadow Waldorf school, where the kids were banned, the vaccination rate was just 33 percent when the December ban took effect, Reis writes. Since then, the county said it has risen to 56 percent, though a schools spokeswoman told the Times the share was actually 83 percent either way, short of the mandated threshold.  During Azars second day on Capitol Hill this week, Democratic lawmakers spent part of the two-hour hearing grilling him on the administrations family separation policy. We continue to hear reports that family separation is still occurring, despite a judges order to stop it, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee said in her opening statement. We are also learning that it may have started earlier than previously known in July 2017. The administration may have separated thousands more children before Congress and the public learned of this immoral policy. She told Azar his agency is complicit with government-sponsored abuse. When asked by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) about whether there was any funding in the Trump's latest budget request to address the issue of separated children, Azar explained there isnt an ongoing program other than the normal family separations we have because of child welfare done by [The Department of Homeland Security]. We dont have a bigger issue right now in terms of separation; we receive a relatively small number, which are according to standards which are fairly consistent with the long time history of the program, he said.\u00a0He did acknowledge issues with information flows. Thats the biggest issue. I demanded back in June we put a box on the intake form any indication of separation, so theres an easy way to track that thats happened, he said. Weve asked for more information from DHS on any rationale why there was a separation because that can be useful to us. We dont decide or get to veto a separation but that helps us decide whether theres a reunification or sponsorship issue. Azar responded: Let me be very clear theres no dispute between us that children being away from their parents is a bad thing, that it poses mental health issues, he said. Thats why we have encouraged people, do\u00a0not come across the border illegally.

Martha McSally (R-Ariz.)\u00a0is asking the Air Force to have a summit on sexual assault in the military.\u00a0The freshman senator, who revealed last week during a congressional hearing that she had been raped by a superior while serving in the Air Force, sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson calling on her to gather with senior leaders and policy experts for a discussion within the next month, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports. I firmly believe that commanders must be fully responsible for preventing and responding to sexual assault in the ranks, she wrote. However, if we truly want to see aggressive change, we must take a fresh look at what else needs to be done in our approach to education, prevention, investigation and prosecution of these crimes.\u00a0\u00a0 She cited statistics from the Department of Defense that found in 2017, 5,277 service members reported being sexually assaulted during their military service. And these were just the women and men who bravely chose to report their assault, McSally wrote to Wilson. This is simply unacceptable. A scientist prepares to inject embryos with Cas9 protein at a lab in Shenzhen, China. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP) \u00a0The National Institutes of Health and a group of scientists and ethicists from seven countries have separately called for a moratorium on gene-editing experiments meant to alter certain heritable traits in babies. The new call for a moratorium is an acknowledgment that the many warnings emerging from conferences on the ethics of gene editing have not been sufficiently clear and emphatic and, in the case of the Chinese twins, have failed to prevent an ethical violation, he adds. Separately, NIH Director Francis Collins issued a statement supporting the call for a moratorium and told The Post this was the position of the federal government\u00a0and was cleared at the highest levels. What were talking about here is one of the most fundamental moments of decision about the application of science to something of enormous societal consequence. Are we going to cross the line toward redesigning ourselves? Collins said. \u00a0The paper in Nature does not call for a permanent ban on gene editing of heritable traits.
