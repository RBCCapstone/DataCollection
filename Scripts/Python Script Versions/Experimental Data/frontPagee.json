Chief Executive Elon Musk\u2019s announcement on Thursday that the electric vehicle maker would close \u201cmany\u201d of its stores around the world to sell cars online-only removes the only retail outlet for solar sales since Musk pulled the plug on a partnership with Home Depot last June.  \u201cSolar is now the stepchild at Tesla. They\u2019ve made two decisions in a row that deal crippling blows to the solar business and they may be regretting the Home Depot idea,\u201d said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel thoughtfully done, it\u2019s rushed. Basically it will hurt them from a brand and marketing point of view,\u201d Gillett said.  When Tesla made its offer for SolarCity - a debt-laden solar-panel sales and installation company founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins - its stock price was down 70 percent from its all-time high. Musk cast the deal as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d rife with synergies, in which customers could be sold both cars and solar energy systems.  That has not yet proven to be the case, and Tesla\u2019s solar business has been shrinking as selling the Model 3 sedan became Tesla\u2019s priority. As part of company-wide layoffs last June, Tesla closed about a dozen solar installation facilities.  Tesla said all sales for its energy and solar products around the world would now be online only, too.  \u201cThe majority of our residential solar and Powerwall orders are already placed outside our retail stores, including online or via referral, and we believe this shift to online sales, paired with a dedicated energy adviser from our support team, will result in the best, most seamless customer experience in the industry,\u201d a Tesla spokesman told Reuters.  Tesla cited a cut in prices of its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in November, representing savings of between $3,000-$5,000 on average, helped by streamlining its sales operations, and said the shift to online sales would unlock additional cost efficiencies. [nL2N1XQ1O6   Ending the deal with Home Depot, whose stores generate high foot traffic, took a huge bite out of Tesla solar sales. In the fourth quarter, the company deployed 73 megawatts of retrofit solar systems, down 21 percent from the prior quarter and well below SolarCity\u2019s more than 200 megawatts a quarter in early 2016. Total energy generation and storage revenue fell 7 percent from the prior quarter to $371.5 million.  Besides selling private-label and third-party solar panels, Tesla sells energy storage systems for home and business use, so-called Powerwalls and Powerpacks. Tesla has said nearly all Powerwall-only orders are placed via the web or certain third-party solar installers.  Installations of the solar roof tiles unveiled by Musk in 2016 are at a \u201cslow pace,\u201d Tesla said in its 2018 annual report, due to design changes. Progress at Tesla\u2019s solar factory in Buffalo, New York, where the tiles are to be manufactured, meanwhile, has been stalled by assembly-line problems.  One former solar seller laid off in January told Reuters that 70 percent of leads on solar had come from Home Depot. Upper management at Tesla \u201cdidn\u2019t appreciate the significance\u201d of the deal with the big-box retailer, the source said.  Musk said Tesla will still keep open a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries and information centres, where details about energy products will also be offered.  When customers order a car on Tesla\u2019s website, they are alerted during the configuration process to the possibility of ordering solar or other energy products.  In January, Tesla said it was \u201cstill in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.\u201d  But former solar salespeople told Reuters that Tesla had already put solar on the back burner, with Tesla-branded panels not even available for installations in the latter half of 2018.  \u201cThey\u2019d tell us the focus of the company is the Model 3,\u201d said one former seller, who left the company in January. \u201cThe Model 3 has to be successful or there\u2019s no company.\u201d ", "tags": ["principal analyst", "wide layoffs", "residential solar systems", "private label", "solar sales"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Wisconsin commission, residents mull proposed solar farms", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/d14c0b43c1c44ea59d465b71e5269f7e"}, {"title": "Elon Musk just sent this memo to employees about the cheaper Model 3 and store closures", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/elon-musk-memo-about-cheaper-model-3-store-closures.html"}, {"title": "Tesla enters uncharted territory after move to dismantle store network", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1QI4RP-OCATC"}]}, {"title": "L Brands plans to close roughly 53 Victoria's Secret stores this year, after mixed holiday results", "source": "cnbc", "date": "2019-02-28T12:45:00Z", "origContent": "L Brands plans to close roughly 53 Victoria's Secret stores in 2019, as the lingerie retailer continues to lose steam against newer rivals.

The trade war between the world's largest economies has raised prices for consumers and companies. It's also deepened concerns that escalating tariffs could worsen the global economy's slowdown.

The escalators bright red and blue hues and a large LED ceiling (that creates the illusion of a blue sky) pop in sharp contrast with the grey curtains used to cordon off a dusty construction area. Change is afoot on the ground floor of one Manhattans most iconic department stores. The sense of theatre epitomizes what Metrick, who has been president of the HBC-owned Saks since 2015, is convinced the company has to offer todays shoppers, particularly at its 650,000 square-foot New York City flagship. The buzz of activity comes at a time when Saks has some wind in its sails again after faring a rough patch three years ago. Sales were declining quarter after quarter. It was losing market share and the Grande Dame of New York luxury, a fixture since 1924, had lost much of what made it stand out. Now, Saks has reported seven quarters of comparable sales gains in the last eight, including a 7.3% jump in the third quarter. And, to Metricks big satisfaction, that recent performance bested those of two major rivalsNordstrom and Neiman Marcusover the same period. But those competitors are not idling: both Neiman and Nordstrom are adding their first namesake department stores in New York this year. The luxury market might be crowded but it is booming: according to Bain & Co, the U.S. personal luxury goods market rose 5% to $85 billion in the United States. Whats more, Spectrem Group estimates there are now 10 million Americans with a net worth between $1 million and $5 million, up 67% from a decade ago.  A run of the mill store just wont do, both in terms of the physical location but also how tech is integrated into them. Ergo a $250 million invested in the multi-year remodel of the flagship of a 41-store chain. While the renovation doesnt feature anything outlandish like the indoor ski hill Saks installed in the 1930s (try getting a CFO to sign-off on that today) its still trying to channel that spirit as it looks to make the Fifth Avenue store a modern-day destination. Last year, the beauty section moved up a floor but not without getting 40% more space and new amenities like facial workouts and offering anti-cellulite treatments and. The area, historically on street level to generate shopper visits, offers clean sightlines with more natural light from outside, a feature all floors will have by 2021. (The next project is mens shoes, now spread out over three floors, but soon to be concentrated in one lavish area.) Shopping isnt the only component of Metricks vision for Saks as a New York destination: the evening of a recent press preview, Saks had its first VIP dinner at LAvenue, a new high-end Philippe Starck-designed restaurant on the 9th floor. Its the only outpost of the Paris eatery that attracts A-list names like Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9. While Saks is thriving now, it was a different story just a few years ago. HBC, a department store conglomerate that also includes its namesake Canadian chain and Lord & Taylor, bought Saks for $2.4 billion in 2013.  There had been turmoil in the c-suite, strategy lurches, and the prevailing opinion that Saks was an icon adrift. So when Metrick, now a 23-year veteran of the brand, took the reins in 2015, he immediately began with a deep dive into customer perceptions. Among the humbling results: Saks and its archrival Neiman Marcus were interchangeable in shoppers eyes. After years of trying to be all things to all people, Saks didnt stand for anything, Metrick recalls.  And thats no small order, what with some 85% of any luxury department stores offerings overlapping with rivals. Its also not getting easier at a time brands themselves are opening more of their own stores and taking more control of how their wares are presented. The high-end department stores added to their own problems in the last decade by getting more promotional, says Bain & Co partner Vandana Radhakrishnan. That led many brands, from Coach and Ralph Lauren on up to focus more on their own stores. But luxury brands, particularly smaller ones, can only do so much with their own sites and stores in reaching a wide audience. So great, well-trafficked stores and strong e-commerce are remedies for that problem. Notably, Metrick says he can give detailed customer data to luxury brands, including what other brands they like. Thats why Metrick sees reinventing the flagship as so important, with many ideas being adapted to the 40 other stores in the fleet. Metrick says thats already paying off: online return rates are typically 40% to 50%, a cost that pinches margins. That drops to 20% for sales clinched via the Salesfloor service. Every year, some 30 million people visit a Saks store, while Saks.com gets 150 million visits. At stores, 20% of visits yield a sale, while online the rate is more like 2.5%. And so while not as flashy as a designer escalator, ecommerce is crucial for maintaining momentum. Shes thinking about every other online experience out shes having today and is Saks as easy as all that, says HBC CEO Helena Foulkes of the prototypical Saks shopper. Saks was recently reminded of how hard it is to win over the modern shopper, even on its home turf. In January, it closed a womens store in Lower Manhattan after only two years.  But Foulkes, previously president of CVS pharmacys $80 billion retail business, won kudos from analysts for dropping an underperforming location and zeroing in on where Saks can win. The next dollar I invest has to be in the place with the most upside, she says.  To enable that, Foulkes has been busy in her first year on the job making big moves to undo much of HBCs aggressive expansion in the last half decade, one that led it to go around chasing stars, as Scotiabank retail and consumer analyst Patricia Baker puts it. That has included paying down HBCs sizeable debt by selling off half of its struggling European business, its Lord & Taylor flagship 10 blocks south of Saks, and Gilt Groupe; moves that won it recent upgrades from debt agencies. HBC also recently announced the closure of 20 Off Fifth discount stores and halted its Canadian expansion of Saks, which had called for seven stores, opting instead to cap it at three.  Thats not to say HBC is only in contraction modethe company is planning a new Saks store at the American Dream mega-mall being built in East Rutherford, New Jersey. But it does signal that HBC is doubling down on best performing businessSaksparticularly the flagship. Though HBC doesnt break out individual stores numbers, the Manhattan flagship generates at least $600 million a year, or 15% of so of Saks total sales. The Saks brand is only going to be as strong as that Fifth Avenue store, says Scotiabanks Baker. And Saks doesnt want its so-called branches to be seen as backwaters. So edgy brands like V\u00eatements and Jacquemus are now sold at other stores too, not just Manhattan. Other ideas have also made their way to its branches in other markets. Take The Collective, an area that focuses up and coming brands, including to solidify what Metrick calls Saks fashion authority. Our role in the fashion ecosystem is to be the place to introduce brands to our consumer, he says.  A more subtle part of Saks store remodel has been to mix up price points and brands rather than consign all ultra high end designer items in the same areas, as they were before. On the fifth floor for instance, more accessible brands like Acne and Alexander Wang are next to designers like Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Simone Rocha. Under Metrick and Foulkes, Saks has a much faster metabolism now. Fail fast and move on. And that, he says, is merely a reflection of how customer behavior has evolved. The luxury consumer is certainly less forgiving and less patient that they used to be, Metrick says.", "tags": ["lavish area", "blue hues", "fifth avenue store", "large led ceiling", "scotiabank"], "related_articles": [{"title": "VA ends funding for homeless vet residence in Helena", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/a7b0a4941e6b4350990eb2fe8db4bc8e"}, {"title": "Trump said he wanted more 'highly skilled' immigrants to come to the US.

Now he doesn't. What changed?", "source": "cnbc", "date": "2019-03-01T17:34:00Z", "origContent": "How rapidly things change in Silicon Valley. A month ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemed confident the electric car maker would turn a profit in the first quarter. Now he's predicting a loss. The reversal disclosed on a media call Thursday night overshadowed what was supposed to be good news during a tough week of headlines: Tesla was finally unveiling its long-awaited Model 3 sedan at $35,000. The shares, already under pressure from Musk's ongoing tussle with federal securities regulators, tanked by almost 8 percent in midday trading Friday. To make its popular electric car at a more affordable price for consumers, Musk said the company has to trim stores, cut employees and shift sales online. It's all part of a push to profitably sell the long-anticipated (and much delayed) $35,000 variant of the Model 3, the midsize sedan Musk and company had long bet would take Tesla from a niche manufacturer to a major automaker. On Jan. 30, Musk told investors he thought Tesla would continue making money after finally turning its first back-to-back profits during the third and fourth quarters of last year, fulfilling his previous forecast that Tesla would become \"sustainably profitable\" from the third quarter of 2018 onward. \"I would say at this point I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1,\" Musk said on the Jan. 30 conference call discussing the company's fourth-quarter earnings. \"Not by a lot, but I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.\" Musk cited one-time charges this quarter as one major factor, though he did not specify what those are. The company has $920 million in debt due Friday, and Musk has previously said it had enough cash on hand to cover. He also said there have been some difficulties getting cars to China and Europe. How much money Tesla can make selling a cheaper Model 3, and whether customers will actually buy it, are major concerns among investors. \"Tesla cut the size of their battery by 30 percent to get this $35,000 base unit out the door,\" said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners. That is probably a reduction in cost of about $5,500 per car, Irwin said. But who wants a low-range car, he said. \"They killed the 60 kWh Model S for poor demand, and even weaker margins,\" he said. \"It seems to dovetail nicely that 2019 will see major margin pressure,\" he said. The fact that the company is moving all vehicle sales online and cutting retail jobs also suggests it is coming to the realization that many industry observers suspected all along profitably selling a $35,000 electric car will be very difficult. \"Tesla appears to have answered the question we have long asked around whether the company was going to be able to profitably produce the $35k Model 3 through production efficiencies and increased volumes,\" Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne said in a note to clients Friday. \"Switching the strategy now to shed stores that are the face of the brand beyond Elon Musk's Twitter feed, likely means that management has come to the realization that it was not going to be feasible.\" It is also significant that this is all happening as federal tax credits for Tesla cars start to wind down, said CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson. The first 200,000 customers to buy Tesla cars received a federal tax credit of $7,500. But those were halved at the beginning of the year, after Tesla hit the limit. They will continue to be phased out by the quarter. \"I think it all goes back to the EV tax credits, which are negatively impacting sales and gross margins,\" Nelson said. Red flags went up for Nelson just a few days after the New Year when Tesla said it would cut prices on its vehicles. Then the company announced it would focus on producing higher-cost exports to China and Europe, lay off workers and introduce a Model 3 leasing program, he said. \"The earnings warning just confirms these red flags, and while it's a bit early to say, it appears that the company's profitability challenges could potentially linger well beyond Q1,\" he said. The announcement certainly was abrupt and did not appear to be made from a position of strength, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a note Friday. But over the long term there are still several levers Tesla can pull to improve profits, including reducing sales and manufacturing costs as well as driving higher sales volume with the cheaper Model 3, its leasing programs and international expansion, he said. \"In some ways, we believe CEO Musk's recent focus on profitability each quarter may have been misplaced and that Tesla might be best served by looking to press its brand and first mover advantage by aggressively making and distributing its cars which yesterday's move appears to be doing,\" he said.", "tags": ["electric car maker", "say point", "cheaper model", "time charges", "first mover advantage"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Tesla enters uncharted territory after move to dismantle store network", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1QI4RP-OCATC"}, {"title": "Elon Musk just sent this memo to employees about the cheaper Model 3 and store closures", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/elon-musk-memo-about-cheaper-model-3-store-closures.html"}, {"title": "Tesla's store-shuttering strategy may pull the rug out of solar", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/tesla-solar-idINKCN1QJ01A"}]}, {"title": "J.C. Penney Once Again Learns It Has to Listen to Shoppers", "source": "fortune", "date": "2019-02-28T22:30:42Z", "origContent": "J.C. Penney(jcp)on Thursday reported a dismal set of holiday season numbers, yet its shares shot up 25%. That paradox is explained by the fact that new CEO Jill Soltau made clear to investors that Penney would align its strategy to what customers want from it, not what executives hope they want. Comparable sales fell 6% during the fourth quarter, a stark contrast to the excellent performances of rivals like Walmart and Target and even mediocre numbers from Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s. And they came in below analysts expectations for a 4.7% drop, according to Consensus Metrix. What\u2019s more, Penney said it would close another 18 stores (two years ago it closed 140) and not give financial forecasts for 2019, news that typically sinks stocks. But Soltau, who came to Penney in the fall from JoAnn Stores, reassured Wall Street and made clear she will focus the department store on where it can perform well with an eye on long term results. \u201cWe are providing strategic clarity to the team that we will always be about serving the customers and growing in a sustainable and profitable manner,\u201d Soltau told analysts on a conference call. For good measure, she has filled a few key roles, like chief merchant, though some c-suite jobs remain vacant. But Marvin Ellison, the Penney CEO who bolted for Lowe\u2019s(low) last spring, committed a similar misreading of his customer, albeit to much less detriment. Three years ago, Ellison, who had been a top executive at Home Depot for years before joining Penney, decided to bring back appliances, a category Penney had dropped in 1983 but one he knew inside out from his time at Home Depot. He was pinning his hopes on grabbing market share from a crumbling Sears and making better use of floor space at Penney. Rather than improve its core business, particularly women\u2019s apparel, Penney got distracted by appliances, where it was going up against much better equipped and capitalized rivals like Home Depot and Best Buy and never really stood a chance. The lesson is that going into a line of business because that\u2019s what a CEO knows well or what he hopes customers to take a liking to leads to retail trouble. During Ellison\u2019s tenure, repeatedly had to mark down enormous amounts of women\u2019s clothing that flopped with customers, killing profits but also losing ground to chains like Target and its increasingly popular clothing brands. (Incidentally, Penney\u2019s new chief merchant is a Target alumnus.) Soltau herself said as much: \u201cThere is a lot of action we need to take to reestablish and repair the fundamentals of retail.\u201d", "tags": ["home depot", "macy", "target", "best buy", "conference call"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Old Navy spins off from Gap, as company says it plans to close roughly 230 Gap stores", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/28/old-navy-split-gap-which-stay-banana-republic/3020322002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}, {"title": "Canada gets closer to a right to repair law", "source": "cbc-news", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-right-to-repair-styrofoam-1.5037697"}, {"title": "Victoria's Secret says it is shuttering 53 more stores", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/28/victorias-secret-store-closings-l-brands-shuttering-53-locations/3020995002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}]}, {"title": "America\u2019s Trucker Shortage Is About to Hit Consumers Where It Hurts", "source": "fortune", "date": "2019-03-02T22:00:21Z", "origContent": "Americas trucker shortage is about to hit consumers right where it hurts: in the kitty litter. McDonalds Corp.s long-time distributor Martin-Brower Co. is raising delivery fees, imperiling low menu prices, and Procter & Gamble Co., Church & Dwight Co. and Hasbro Inc. are sounding the alarm that higher freight fees could be passed on to consumers of everything from Crest toothpaste to Arm & Hammer cat litter to My Little Pony figurines. And its all because transport companies cant find drivers. Millennials, they dont want to drive trucks, said Darren Tristano, CEO and founder of consultant Foodservice Results. Theyre looking at this and saying, I want to be in something more glamorous, more tech-oriented. America simply doesnt have enough truck drivers to deliver everything its people buy. Thats not new, but many retailers are just now feeling the pain as annual shipping contracts are renewed. That has trucking companies scrambling to find ways to keep costs down. And it has Michael Norwich counting every dime and quarter as he contemplates the $4.99 combo meal whose price is dictated at Jack in the Box Inc. headquarters. Distribution costs are huge, said Norwich, who owns 14 of the fast-food restaurants in El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Im scratching my head trying to figure out how $4.99 is going to work. The trucking industry is also trying to recruit more women, who currently make up a small fraction of the workforce. Drivers who own their own trucks and pay their own expenses can make gross pay of as much as $250,000 a year and receive a hiring bonus of $5,000 by joining J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., according to the companys website. The trucking giant is also advertising long-haul positions that pay $65,000 a year plus a $2,500 hiring bonus and require only three months of experience and promise little lifting of freight. Its still difficult to find good quality drivers, executive vice president Nicholas Hobbs said in January. Companies are trying to push down costs by using software to optimize routes and moving some cargo to rail. While cheaper, those rates have risen and arent as flexible as having a truck travel point to point. Still, its difficult keeping prices down. Tariffs are increasing the price of truck parts coming from China and imported aluminum and steel. Fuel increases, too, are having an effect. Retail chains are also trying to cut shipping expenses where they can. TJX Cos.s HomeGoods furniture chain said Wednesday that increased pressure from freight is weighing on margin. Its opening more distribution centers in the U.S. to mitigate mounting costs. So is Hasbro, which plans to open a new hub in Joliet, Illinois, after shipping costs surged in 2018. Procter & Gamble, maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, is feeling the heat, too. The company recently blamed a 25 percent jump in trucking costs for narrowing margins. P&G raised prices last year on some products, and has said its still too early to divulge its pricing strategy for 2019. Higher transportation costs are headwinds that we have to overcome, Church & Dwight CEO Richard Dierker said Feb. 21. The company identified a bright side to the jump in trucking expenses \u2014 competitors are also raising prices. Walmart Inc., which has its own fleet of 6,500 trucks, offered $1,500 referral bonuses last year and shortened the hiring process to attract more drivers. For Amazon.com Inc., freight costs consistently outpace online sales growth. The company is trying to find cheaper ways to deliver packages or it may have to hike prices. It already raised its annual Prime membership fee by 20 percent to $120 last year, the first hike since 2014. And then theres the McDonalds menu. Martin-Brower ships to 12,372 restaurants in the U.S. and 20,208 globally, so the sting of higher fees is widespread. Because much of the McDonalds menu is priced at company headquarters and reinforced by a national advertising campaign, franchisees are looking for places they have leeway to set their own prices and $1 drinks are candidates. We must be able to pass these increases along to our customers, a group of McDonalds franchisees said in a Feb. 27 website post. The bottom line is their costs are going up and so are ours.", "tags": ["competitors", "tariffs", "quarter", "china", "low menu prices"], "related_articles": [{"title": "\u2018Amazon Day\u2019 Shipping Option Aims to Reduce Deliveries and CO2 Emissions", "source": "fortune", "url": "http://fortune.com/2019/03/01/amazon-day-delivery-emissions/"}, {"title": "Lyft kicks off 2019 unicorn IPO spree with public S-1", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-ipo-public-s-1-filing-details-2019-2"}, {"title": "How to tell exactly which iPad model you have", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-ipad-model-do-i-have"}]}, {"title": "Walmart and Affirm are partnering to offer point-of-sale financing in-store and online (WMT)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-02-28T15:05:00Z", "origContent": " Walmart is partnering with digital-first financing player Affirm to offer point-of-sale (POS) financing at checkout in-store at nearly 4,000 Walmart Superstores in the US and on Walmart.com in the coming weeks, following rumors dating back to 2017.  The partnership will enable Walmart shoppers to choose Affirm at checkout and select a repayment period of 3, 6, or 12 monthly installments for purchases between $150 and $2,000.   This news follows another recent move by Walmart to restructure its payment options: Walmart recently announced the ending of its 19-year issuing partnership with major private-label card issuer Synchrony Financial and selected Capital One as the new issuer for its store cards and cobranded products.   This partnership comes alongside rising consumer awareness in alternative financing and can help propel Affirm to the forefront of the financing space.   Seventy-eight percent of US consumers were aware of POS financing options as of 2017, up from 51% in 2015. Rising consumer awareness in alternative financing options will likely continue to be instrumental in driving volume and demand for these services going forward. Further, the growing popularity of POS financing programs like Affirm and Klarna can pose threats to traditional store cards as consumers might opt to finance a purchase rather than open a new store card and pay off the balance.   Partnering with a top three US retailer could ultimately help Affirm emerge as a leader in the financing space amid crowding. Affirm initially expanded from online-only to brick-and-mortar retail in 2018, allowing merchants to integrate its offering through an application programming interface (API), which gives it an advantage over digital-only competitors as the space becomes more crowded with firms like Klarna, Splitit, and Afterpay all entering the US retail market. Further, partnering with Walmart can substantially increase Affirm's brand visibility to both consumers and other US retailers. Its integration with Walmart can highlight the advantages of POS financing, particularly on influencing customer spending, which could encourage more retailers to adopt Affirm or other financing options: 39% of consumers would spend more money if given instant credit options when shopping online, for example.
