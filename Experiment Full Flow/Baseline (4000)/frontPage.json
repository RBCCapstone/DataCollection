Like many developers, they found working with voice software brought its own set of challenges\u00a0and didn\u2019t yield an immediate payoff. \u201cIt might be the brightest thing I\u2019ve ever done, it might be the dumbest,\u201d Deakin says of the decision to embrace Alexa. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d Echo-branded smart speakers have attracted millions of fans with their ability to play music and respond to queries spoken from across the room. But almost four years after inviting outside developers to write apps for Alexa,\u00a0Amazon\u2019s voice system has yet to offer a transformative new experience. Surveys show most people use their smart speakers to listen to tunes or make relatively simple requests\u2014\u201cAlexa, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d\u2014while more complicated tasks prompt them to give up and reach for their\u00a0smartphone. Developers had less trouble creating hits for previous generations of technology. Think Angry Birds or Pok\u00e9mon Go on the iPhone, or, decades ago, spreadsheets on the first Windows computers.\u00a0Amazon counts some 80,000 \u201cskills\u201d\u2014its name for apps\u2014in\u00a0its marketplace. It seems impressive, but at this point\u00a0in their development, Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store each boasted more than 550,000 applications and minted fortunes for many successful developers.\u00a0 Amazon has gotten creative to get people to try new things, emailing recommendations to Echo owners, programming a range of prompts users can say aloud to try new things, and referring users to the companion Alexa smartphone app. One image on Amazon\u2019s screen-bearing Echo Show model seems to playfully acknowledge that challenge, showing a cartoon image of a person fishing overlaid with text suggesting people ask Alexa what skills are available. Amazon boasted last year that it has some 10,000 employees working on Alexa software and related devices. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who has delegated most day-to-day operations\u00a0to lieutenants, remains personally involved with Alexa, according to one former employee who stays in touch with colleagues on the project. Bezos has even reviewed some skills prior to their publication on the marketplace. But that hasn\u2019t helped Amazon build a more dynamic app marketplace. Google and Apple, which trail Amazon in smart speaker sales, also lack a unique, voice-centric hit. Many people have given up even looking for one: Fully half of smart speaker users says they don\u2019t seek out applications, according to a survey by voice software news site Voicebot and Voicify, which makes developer tools. \u201cThere are kind of a cluster of features people are coming to expect for voice: a daily news summary, weather, timers\u00a0and a random fact,\u201d said James Moar, an analyst at Juniper Research who tracks voice software. Beyond that? \u201cPeople aren\u2019t really experimenting that much.\u201d For now, Amazon is doing plenty of investing, building out guides and tools for developers, and offering stipends to the people behind the most successful apps. One\u00a0is Nick Schwab, a developer at Ford Motor Co. who started tinkering with Alexa after purchasing a cylindrical Echo speaker. His first software program, which gathered and read the offerings from daily deals websites, didn\u2019t take off. Later experiments were more successful. He built an app called Opening Bell, the first of its kind on Alexa, that let people ask for stock prices by company name. A couple of months later, eager to drown out a noisy neighbor, he built an Alexa skill that turned his hockey puck-shaped Echo Dot into a white noise machine. That was a hit, and he quickly expanded the range of sounds he offered customers. Last year, Amazon gave developers their first tools to make their own money selling Alexa skills. Schwab took advantage, charging a $1.99 monthly subscription for access to different sounds. Amazon takes a 30 percent cut on such sales, the same rate Google and Apple charge on their smartphone app stores.Since Schwab\u2019s work isn\u2019t self-sustaining yet,\u00a0Amazon also sends him monthly checks. Schwab declined to say how much those direct payments are\u00a0but said that they amount to a tidy bonus. The cash helped him pay for his dream car: a Tesla Model 3. It\u2019s unclear how many people receive such payments, which, developers say, top out at $5,000 per month for each Skill, or how much the company has paid out in total. The payments, part of a program called Alexa Developer Rewards, are \u201cmeant to be a launchpad, to help boost the ecosystem until developers have the ability to start businesses that are really sustainable,\u201d\u00a0Schwab says. Amazon says four out of five Alexa users have tried a Skill developed by outsiders. Dave Limp, the senior vice president who oversees the Alexa and devices group, said last year that music, for many, was the killer app. So-called smart home skills that let people use Alexa voice commands to control home appliances have also emerged as a popular use for the software.\u00a0Many of those functions were built by Amazon itself, or are modified versions of software other large companies, like Spotify or streaming video providers, had already created. Many of the developers who have been successful with Alexa so far are like Schwab, working on their own or in small shops. Popular apps tend to be organized around a single, relatively simple theme, like Schwab's Sleep Sounds, trivia (Question of the Day), or productivity (a skill called Chompers tells jokes and facts to keep kids from losing focus while brushing their teeth). Marketers and technology companies are keeping a close eye on Alexa, but many haven\u2019t built anything on the platform. Holding them back, people who advise those companies say, is a lack of expertise with voice recognition technology and the uncertain prospect of making money on the platform amid a prohibition on most advertising on Alexa. There's also the essential question of what tasks people would rather complete with their voice than another device using their eyes and fingers. \u201cLook at the internet in 1995, the first websites were not moneymakers,\u201d says\u00a0Brandon Kaplan, chief executive of Skilled Creative, a marketing startup that has worked on voice software projects with PepsiCo Inc. and CBS Corp.\u2019s Simon & Schuster. \u201cPeople are still playing around, figuring out what they can build.\u201d Musicplode\u2019s game, Beat the Intro, hasn\u2019t had a problem finding a large base of users, in part because of a close relationship with Amazon, which has promoted Musicplode\u2019s work at the launch of new products and in best-of lists. The game challenges users to identify a song title and artist as quickly as possible after it starts playing. Last August, Beat the Intro started asking users who wanted more than 30 minutes of gameplay to opt into a paid subscription service. While early returns are promising, Deakin says, they aren\u2019t yet sufficient to cover the cost of licensing its music catalog and streaming the songs to users. \u201cIf developers can't find a way to monetize their skills,\u201d Deakin says,\u00a0\u201cthey won't work with it.\u201d", "tags": ["random fact", "hottest trends", "surveys", "first software program", "voice software site"], "related_articles": [{"title": "More Google-powered speakers will be able to make calls (GOOGL)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-expanding-assistant-calling-smart-speakers-2019-3"}, {"title": "Jeff Bezos says a 3-word phrase can help you make decisions quickly and become a better leader", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-efficient-decision-making-jeff-bezos-2019-3"}, {"title": "Heavyweight Boeing pressures Dow, while tech lifts S&P & Nasdaq", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-idINKBN1QS1AX"}]}, {"title": "The Daily 202: Russia may experiment with new forms of interference in Ukraine\u2019s elections, experts warn", "source": "the-washington-post", "date": "2019-03-13T14:04:22Z", "origContent": "THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0The Russians could use the looming Ukrainian elections as a proving ground to test innovative forms of interference that might, if successful, be weaponized against the United States during the 2020 presidential campaign. I consider Ukraine ground zero when it comes to foreign meddling in elections because a lot is at stake for Russia, former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an interview. We don't know in advance which technologies Russia will use. We do know that they will come up with more and more sophisticated methods. That's why we need to be at the forefront by witnessing what they are actually doing. Rasmussen runs a group called the Alliance of Democracies. Its flagship initiative is the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, whose co-chairs include former vice president Joe Biden and former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff. The Alliance is deploying seven observers to monitor the Ukrainian elections. The first round of voting is March 31. Assuming no presidential candidate in the crowded field gets more than 50 percent, a runoff will be held on April 21. The groups goal is to draw attention to disinformation and to work with the private sector to combat the proliferation of new technologies that keep intelligence professionals up at night, especially deep fake audio and video files. These are doctored but appear amazingly authentic and can go viral on social media. Rasmussen, who also formerly served as the prime minister of Denmark, led NATO in 2014 when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Five years later, Russian forces are still on the peninsula and Ukraines deadly conflict with Russian-backed separatists drags on. No doubt about it, we were taken by surprise when he attacked Ukraine, Rasmussen said. I dont think we underestimate Russia any longer. We met for lunch at Sonoma on Capitol Hill after he testified before the House Intelligence Committee recently. Over hamburgers, he outlined machinations by Moscow that he worries are still going on under the radar and expressed hope that Washington elites can avoid viewing the response through a partisan lens. The whole purpose is not to strengthen left wings or right wings, but it's just to sow mistrust and lack of confidence in our democratic institutions and our democratic process, Rasmussen said. That would be true whether it was President Trump in the White House or someone else. There is strong evidence that the Russians have interfered to varying degrees during elections abroad by using traditional propaganda, manipulating social media platforms and in some cases illicitly funding allies. Rasmussen pointed to a recent report by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that found Russia is responsible for 80 percent of disinformation activities in Europe and highlighted Microsofts recent announcement that it detected efforts by Moscow to phish the servers of European think tanks. In Ukraine, the Transatlantic Commission has partnered with the Atlantic Council and the Victor Pinchuk Foundation to stand up an elections task force. Its led by David Kramer, the former president of Freedom House and an assistant secretary of state under George W. Bush. The operation includes a rapid-response war room aimed at identifying evidence of interference in real-time by using sophisticated new software tools. We should not forget that in many Eastern European countries people say, We did not get rid of communism just to replace Moscow with Brussels, so we have to carefully consider how we speak up, Rasmussen explained. Officials are on edge that agents of the Kremlin could try to hack into the networks of the various candidates or disable phones, electrical grids and maybe even airport control systems. Their intent could range from suppressing get-out-the-vote operations to making the government look incompetent at the most inopportune moments to simply creating mass chaos. Western observers are also nervous that Russia will try to hack into the Ukrainian elections website to publish false results in a bid to cast doubts on the validity of the real results. This isnt academic. It happened during their last presidential election. A pro-Russian hacking group called CyberBerkut deleted vote-tallying system files and leaked private emails from the Central Election Commission. The public-facing results website was also hacked. It falsely identified a far-right candidate as the winner until authorities could regain control of their servers. Unlike in U.S. elections, the Ukrainians must also worry about the real possibility of Russia using conventional military force, whether harassing their ships in the Sea of Azov or massing troops along the border or activating sleeper cells inside Kiev to conduct sabotage and foment violence in the streets. We need to pay more immediate attention to Ukraine because it is not part of NATO and they are in many ways a symbol of some of the things going on, said former secretary of state Madeline Albright, who testified alongside Rasmussen before the House Intelligence Committee. We are still underestimating Russia. Putin is just a flat-out dictator. I used to be a Soviet expert and I kind of look at my library and I think its archaeology. Nope! They are trying to rebuild the system, and theyre using these asymmetrical tools. -- After reading an op-ed Biden wrote that called for a 9/11-style commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Rasmussen reached out to him about partnering on something more global. Last March, they unveiled the transatlantic initiative together. It has already monitored 10 referendums and elections, including the U.S. midterms. They were especially alarmed to see what happened last September in Macedonia during a referendum on changing the countrys name, which might have sped up the countrys entry into NATO a development Russia strongly opposes. There was a surge in new Facebook and Twitter bot accounts during the month before the vote that urged people to boycott, abstain and stay home. Rasmussen believes the Russians were trying to keep turnout rates below 50 percent so that the results would be invalid. Ultimately, turnout was only 37 percent. We detected some unusual activity on social media, but it was a bit difficult for us to identify the origin, and this is the reason why we didn't make it public, he said. But we reported our results to the local authorities, the state authorities, so its for them to look into whether it was domestic meddling or whether foreign actors intervened. In general, the state of the midterm elections was much, much better than in 2016. But we also know that the Russians have become much more sophisticated so we have to keep up the pace. -- Dont forget: One of the crimes Paul Manafort will be sentenced for by a federal judge in Washington today is his undisclosed work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Special counsel Bob Muellers team alleged last month that the former Trump campaign chairman was still working on Ukrainian political matters in 2018, even after his indictment. Manafort purportedly met with Konstantin Kilimnik to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine on more than one occasion, including in August 2016. This has long been a top foreign policy goal for Putin because a settlement is a prerequisite to the West to relax stiff sanctions on Russia. Prosecutors have also said that Manafort worked with Kilimnik on a poll of Ukraine just last year. Five years after the countrys pro-Western revolution, its people still thirst for change. Street protests in 2014 marked a decisive turn away from Moscow, but they did far less to modernize the economy or root out corruption. President Petro Poroshenkos government and administration have been beset by infighting and state spending scandals. The economy, suffering from weak investor confidence and the war in the heavily industrial east, still hasnt recovered from its near-collapse five years ago. The most prominent candidates heading into the election campaign represented the old guard: the incumbent Poroshenko, who is also a chocolate tycoon and one of Ukraines richest men, and the former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Were living in a parallel universe, said a senior Western diplomat in Kiev, who has been catching up on the show. People are confusing whats real and whats fiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first published data about fentanyl in 2013, years before senior administration officials took concrete steps against the drug: The first signs were detected in the spring of 2013 when overdose deaths spiked at the state morgue in Providence. Then-Rhode Island Health Director Michael Fine wondered: What was killing so many so quickly? Fine was surprised to learn when the toxicology reports came back that 12 people who overdosed between March and May had died from fentanyl. On Aug. 30, 2013, the CDC in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report highlighted the unusual spike in Rhode Island. It didnt attract much national attention. Former attorney general Eric Holder received a briefing on fentanyl in June 2014 but didnt take action: Former DEA agents said they provided Holder with a personal briefing that included a 30-slide PowerPoint presentation about the dangers of fentanyl While raising red flags, the PowerPoint presentation itself did not request any particular action. [Holders] former spokesman said it was up to the DEA to ask the attorney general for specific action. Ten months after the briefing, Holder left the administration. By then, fentanyl was spreading across the country. Officials\u00a0rejected a May 2016 plea from national health experts to declare the crisis a public health emergency: The epidemic had been escalating for three years. The 11 experts pressed the officials to declare fentanyl a national public health emergency that would put a laserlike focus on combating the emerging epidemic and warn the country about the threat. The administration considered the request but did not act on it. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) personally warned Obama about the explosion of fentanyl in March 2016.\u00a0But the president wouldnt specifically call it out until his administration's\u00a0final days: Markey\u00a0joined Obama on Air Force One for a trip to Atlanta, where both were scheduled to speak at the National Rx Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit. The senator used the rare one-on-one time to tell the president about fentanyl. On Jan. 11, 2017, in the waning days of the administration, Obama delivered his annual National Drug Control Strategy to Congress. Four years after the epidemic began in Rhode Island, the White House called fentanyl a national crisis. -- The Federal Aviation Administration is standing by its decision not to ground the type of Boeing aircraft that went down in Ethiopia. Michael Laris, Lori Aratani, Josh Dawsey and Toluse Olorunnipa report: The Trump administration resisted bipartisan calls to temporarily suspend use of the Boeing 737 Max 8, even as President Trump consulted by phone with the besieged companys CEO. ... With the European Union and others following Chinas move to bar flights by some of the American aviation giants most important airplanes, former transportation safety officials said the [FAA] risked losing its status as the worlds aviation safety leader. In a conversation with Trump on Tuesday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg argued to keep the planes in the sky, according to a senior administration official. The president has not made a final decision on what should be done in response to the Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia and Indonesia crashes, the official said, and is expected to have more meetings Wednesday. ... Former U.S. transportation secretary Ray LaHood, who was a GOP congressman before being appointed by President Barack Obama, said current Secretary Elaine Chao should immediately ground the aircraft. But acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell said late Tuesday that his agencys extensive review of aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boeing 737 MAX . . . shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft. --\u00a0Chao flew on the Max 8 from Austin to Washington yesterday. -- Meanwhile, a growing chorus of lawmakers from both parties is demanding the 737 Max 8\u00a0should be banned from U.S. airspace for now.\u00a0Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said the FAA should ground the planes out of an abundance of caution for the flying public. So did Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.).\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on aviation and space, promised to quickly hold a hearing to investigate the crashes. (John Wagner and Felicia Sonmez) -- Pilots repeatedly complained for months to federal authorities about a safety\u00a0feature\u00a0for months before Sundays crash. The Dallas Morning Newss Cary Aspinwall, Ariana Giorgi and Dom DiFurio report: [A]t least five complaints about the Boeing model [were found] in a federal database where pilots can voluntarily report about aviation incidents without fear of repercussions. The complaints are about the safety mechanism cited in preliminary reports about an October plane crash in Indonesia that killed 189. Records show that a captain who flies the Max 8 complained in November that it was unconscionable that the company and federal authorities allowed pilots to fly the planes without adequate training or fully disclosing information about how its systems were different from previous 737 models. -- The decision not to ground the planes is the latest example of a passive Department of Transportation,\u00a0writes\u00a0the Wall Street Journals Scott McCartney:\u00a0Thirty-five Congressional mandates sit unanswered, on everything from minimum seat space to secondary barriers protecting cockpits. The top job at the Federal Aviation Administration has been open for 14 months. Enforcement fines against major U.S. airlines have dropped 88% in the past two years, even as three-hour tarmac delays have more than doubled. The Transportation Department under Secretary Elaine Chao has seemingly been delayed on a number of issues important to travelers.\u00a0Even with airlines begging for rules on emotional-support animals, and both Republicans and Democrats expressing concerns about swollen fees, shrunken seating and punitive airline policies, the DOT has been loath to issue new regulations.\u00a0\u00a0 Sales of Boeing planes have been important to President Trumps trade and employment objectives. But pressure is mounting, and if investigators find the same system is responsible for both crashes, it will be increasingly difficult for the FAA and Ms. Chao to leave a plane with a fatal flaw in the air. -- Trump has a\u00a0lifelong fascination with air travel. Shortly before taking office, Trump threatened to cancel a contract with Boeing for a new Air Force One, saying the costs were too high. Trump, who reached a $3.9\u00a0billion deal with Boeing last year ...\u00a0He also considered appointing his personal pilot to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, and he told a group of airline executives in 2017 that the federal governments air-traffic-control system was 'terrible'\u00a0and 'out of whack.'\"\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa reports.

[He] is widely expected at the Pentagon to be nominated as permanent secretary, but officials have said theres no certainty about his elevation until a White House announcement. The president has been known to change his mind on personnel decisions. Shanahans limited foreign policy experience, particularly with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has prompted some uneasiness on Capitol Hill. Its unclear whether Trump has considered him as a serious candidate for defense secretary, although the president is said to hold him in high regard. VA spokesman Curt Cashour said in an email that Wilkie remains 100 percent focused on his job as VA secretary.\u00a0 Shanahan is scheduled to give his first congressional testimony as acting secretary this week, when he is sure to face tough questions about Trumps defense policies.

(Mark Maske) -- Fifty people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, were charged for allegedly participating in a multimillion-dollar scheme to get their children admitted to prestigious colleges. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: The allegations included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others. In Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBIs Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged. Huffman appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bond. None of the students were charged in the case. The scheme's main architect, William Singer, pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with investigators since September: Officials described Singer as a well-connected college admissions adviser and say he disguised the bribery scheme as a charity, enabling parents to deduct the bribes from their taxes. Singer was charged with taking about $25 million from 2011 to 2018 paying some of it to college coaches or standardized-testing officials for their help rigging the admissions process and pocketing the rest, according to the criminal complaint. Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges for racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said that a month after he came to the governments side, Singer alerted several people under investigation about the inquiry which earned him the obstruction charge. After the charges were unveiled, several of the implicated coaches were fired or put on leave by their universities: Prosecutors also charged Georgetowns former head tennis coach, Gordon Ernst. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits when they were not tennis players of that caliber. After leaving Georgetown, Ernst was hired as the University of Rhode Islands tennis coach. The school said Tuesday he had been placed on administrative leave. Some of the money was directed to Donna Heinel, a USC athletics official, the complaint alleges. Jovan Vavic, the former water polo coach at USC, was charged with taking bribes to pretend students flagged by Singer were recruits for the team. USC said Tuesday that Heinel and Vavic had been fired. -- Stanford fired head sailing coach John Vandemoer after he agreed to plead guilty in the case.\u00a0We have no evidence that the conduct involves anyone else at Stanford or is associated with any other team.

Mark Riddell, a professional tennis player and a really smart guy, according to the feds. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports:\u00a0The brains behind the operation were provided by Riddell, 36, who is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Wednesday. He was the one actually filling in the bubbles, prosecutors allege Riddell has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering. He has been cooperating in the investigation since February of this year, prosecutors said, in the hope of obtaining leniency when he is sentenced. -- The NCAA is now investigating the college coaches who took bribes.\u00a0Amy B Wang and Des Bieler report: The allegations cast an ugly light not only on the often enigmatic college admissions process but on the world of college athletic recruitment. In the wake of the charges, the NCAA said it would investigate the extent of fraud and bribery alleged by the Justice Department. The charges brought forth today are troubling and should be a concern for all of higher education, the NCAA said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. We are looking into these allegations to determine the extent to which NCAA rules may have been violated. Its unclear what violations those would include or which schools would be involved. -- Ironically, Loughlins Full House character, Aunt Becky, stopped her fictional husband from lying to get their children admitted into an elite preschool during a 1993 episode. (Allyson Chiu) -- This scandal is further proof that helicopter parenting has gotten out of hand.\u00a0Amy Joyce, our On Parenting editor, has a smart take: We have gotten to the point in todays fast-paced, hyper-competitive society where parents of privilege are hiring multiple tutors for kids already on the honor roll. Parents write college essays, or hire someone else to do it. Theyre overscheduling kids with extracurriculars that play to college admissions instead of their childrens actual interests. It sounds like overkill, and yet everyone else is doing it. So why not me? they think. The reason: Our kids will grow up to be adults who dont know how to do simple adult things. -- Lower-profile sports like volleyball, water polo and tennis are at the center of the scandal.\u00a0These sports get little attention from fans or the press, but like football and basketball they often get reserved slots in a colleges incoming class.The Timess Marc Tracy and Billy Witz report: Unlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation. The practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Rep. Adam Schiff\u00a0(D-Calif.) speaks to reporters following a closed door House Intelligence Committee meeting with Michael Cohen. (Anna Moneymaker/Bloomberg) -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Trump should probably be indicted after he leaves office for his involvement in\u00a0crimes to which\u00a0Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty. Its very difficult to make the argument that the person who was directed and was coordinated should go to jail, but the person who did the directing and coordinating should not, Schiff said at a gathering of journalists. So I think that that militates very strongly in favor of indicting the president when he is out of office. From Karoun Demirjian: [Schiff] continued to defer to the eventual judgment of the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors there have the evidence to prove the case. But after two days of closed-door sessions in which the intelligence panel interviewed Cohen, Schiff seemed confident that such documentary evidence exists, given that prosecutors indictment of Cohen essentially names the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. -- A newly released transcript of Lisa Pages testimony before the House Judiciary Committee showed how the former FBI lawyer defended the bureau against allegations of bias. Karoun Demirjian, Aaron Blake and Rosalind S. Helderman report: Page, who came to prominence over anti-Trump texts she exchanged with former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok while both were assigned to the Clinton and Trump investigations, stressed that senior bureau officials were also expressing anti-Clinton animus but that neither affected how agents working those cases carried out their jobs. Pages transcript\u00a0is the second released in the past week by the panels ranking Republican, Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), in an effort to make public the record of the now-completed GOP-led probe of how federal law enforcement agencies conducted the two probes. -- Paul Manafort faces his second sentencing at a D.C. court this morning.\u00a0A federal judge could sentence Trump's former campaign manager\u00a0to up to 10 years in prison for crimes related to unregistered foreign lobbying and witness tampering, which are unrelated to Manafort's\u00a0work on the Trump campaign. (ABC News) -- Bob Mueller said Michael Flynn has completed his cooperation with the special counsel's\u00a0investigation. Trumps former national security adviser, however, is still helping out with another federal probe. (Reuters) -- Mueller may eventually produce two reports on his investigation, one focusing\u00a0on crimes and another on\u00a0alleged coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, former federal prosecutor Nelson W. Cunningham writes for the Daily Beast. Significantly, unlike a final criminal report, a Mueller counterintelligence report cannot be bottled up. By statute it must be shared with Congress. [I]t is Muellers counterintelligence report we should really be anticipating. Done well (and Mueller and his team seem to do everything well), it will provide a much richer, broader narrative description of Russias effort to interfere in 2016, the nature of any links or cooperation between the Russians and the Trump campaign, and whether Trump or his associates were witting or unwitting assets for the Russians (including by obstructing the investigation) as well perhaps as conclusions for action. -- But ... a jittery Washington cant wait any longer for Mueller to deliver. The New York Timess Nicholas Fandos and Noah Weiland report: Television crews have been positioned outside the offices of the special counsel, the federal courthouse and, at least before they were asked to leave, the McLean, Va., home of the new attorney general, William P. Barr. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are so desperate for hints that they are asking aides to call Justice Department contacts to beg for morsels. Publishing houses are scrambling to produce instant books of the findings.\u00a0 Real information actually, any information at all from Mr. Muellers astonishingly leak-free team is almost nonexistent. The result is energetic spinning from both parties, who have stepped into the void to try to frame the next chapter of Mr. Trumps presidency. -- The New York attorney generals subpoena of Deutsche Bank is related to three loans the bank approved for the presidents company and another loan Trump sought to buy the Buffalo Bills. David A. Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell report: Trump got $125 million to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170 million to create Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69 million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Trumps tower in Chicago. In addition, the people said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trumps attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2013 a deal that did not materialize. -- Michael Avenatti is no longer serving as Stormy Danielss attorney. Felicia Sonmez reports: Daniels said in a tweet that she has retained\u00a0Tulsa-based attorney Clark Brewster\u00a0as her personal attorney and has asked him to review all legal matters involving her. Guests at the safari party included not only Danilochkin but also Israel Joffe, an official at the FDA, and Li Cindy Yang, the former owner of the massage parlor at the center of an investigation that snared Patriot owner Robert Kraft and others last month, illustrating the way that Trumps private clubs offer a lightly regulated channel into the presidents social circle. -- The White House and several Republican senators are negotiating a deal that could lead to the surprising defeat of a Democratic resolution rejecting\u00a0Trumps emergency declaration at the border.Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner report: Key to quelling the GOP revolt is legislation drafted by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that tries to claw back some emergency powers to Congress and whether the White House endorses some version of it. That would give Republicans who are uneasy about the constitutionality of the Feb. 15 declaration yet nervous about publicly rebuking Trump some political cover to side with the president. Although four Republican senators have already announced they will vote to nullify the presidents emergency declaration, one of them Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) publicly indicated Tuesday after a private meeting with Vice President Pence that he could change his position if the administration and senators strike a deal on revising the National Emergencies Act. That would be enough to kill the resolution in the Senate, provided no other GOP senators oppose Trumps declaration or alter their position. -- House Democrats presented a broad immigration proposal allowing more than 2 million immigrants the opportunity to apply for citizenship, including dreamers and those with temporary work permits who could soon be deported.\u00a0Maria Sacchetti, Erica Werner and David Nakamura report:\u00a0It is unclear how many immigrants would benefit from the legislation, but congressional aides said the number of dreamers probably would be similar to the 2.1 million people who would have been covered under a bipartisan Senate measure that was proposed in 2017, according to the Migration Policy Institute. -- The Trump administration is planning to close all international immigration offices in the coming months. Maria Sacchetti and Nick Miroff report: USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna said in an email to staff Tuesday that he is working to transfer those duties now performed by employees worldwide to domestic offices and the State Departments embassies and consulates. Administration officials say the move will allow them to shift resources to slash backlogs in the United States, and they estimate the government will save millions of dollars each year by phasing out USCIS international offices. But immigration advocates worry it is another Trump administration effort to discourage foreigners from attempting to come to the United States, and experts say closing the offices will shrink the nations engagement with the rest of the world. -- Two-hundred forty\u00a0migrants were sent back to Mexico under an experimental policy requiring Central American migrants to stay there while U.S. asylum claims are processed. Nick Miroff reports: The policy, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, has been expanded in recent days to the Calexico port of entry in California, said Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the implementation of the measures. Immigrant legal advocates are seeking an injunction in federal court to block [the policy],\u00a0which the Trump administration says is necessary to contend with a recent surge of border crossings. -- Trumps continued demands for wall money ignore the difficulty that Customs and Border Patrol has had in hiring and retaining officers. The\u00a0Cipher Briefs Walter Pincus reports: The ability to retain officers is affected by ongoing staff shortages which have required current CBP officers to work overtime. Another major retainment problem has been that some officers are required to work for years in remote areas of the border where there are few schools and a lack of jobs for spouses. Recruitment is another story. In the past, only one out of 130 [CBP] prospects ever made it all the way through the process. Today, that figure is still only about three percent. -- In El Salvador, deportees\u00a0from the United States\u00a0continue battling the poverty, violence and\u00a0crime they hoped to escape. National Geographic's Jason Motlagh and Moises Saman documented the deportation procedures of a group of Salvadorans for this month's\u00a0issue of the magazine: The deportees from\u00a0the United States file out of the buses with their heads down, stripped of belts and shoelaces like criminals. Rounded up from immigration detention centers around the country, theyd been boarded onto an unmarked jet near the Texas-Mexico border early in the morning and flown more than 1,100 miles to an airport outside El Salvadors capital, San Salvador. In just four hours a perilous journey north that had taken many of the migrants years to prepare for and weeks to complete was undone. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took back an office from Vice President Pence.\u00a0(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reclaimed office space in the House that her predecessor Paul Ryan had given to Vice President Pence.NPRs Susan Davis reports: Republicans gave Pence, a former House member, a first-floor bonus office in the U.S. Capitol shortly after President Trump was inaugurated in 2017. The vice president rarely used the space, but it was a symbolic gesture of the warm relationship Pence enjoyed with Ryan and the House GOP. While Pelosi revoked Pence's office privileges, the aide said she is providing new office space for the White House legislative affairs team that it did not previously enjoy under the GOP majority. -- Pelosis assertion that impeaching Trump wouldnt be worth the ensuing political firestorm\u00a0shines a light on the speakers cautious approach to oversight. Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report: Pelosis allies believe her skepticism about impeachment protects her moderates in swing districts, gives her an exit strategy should [Mueller]\u00a0find no wrongdoing by the president, and could even strengthen her leverage if something serious arises and Pelosi reverses course to impeach him later. Tamping down impeachment talk also enables Pelosi to keep the spotlight on the Democratic agenda, she told lawmakers in a private meeting Monday night. Thats critical amid Republican efforts to cast Democrats as obsessed with ousting the president, Pelosi allies argue. Do we want to drag him down or do we want to lift people up? Pelosi asked a group of her peers during a Monday night huddle. --\u00a0Democratic lawmakers agreed to refrain from\u00a0questioning Commerce Secretary Wilbur Rosss possible ethics violations during a hearing today\u00a0on the Trump administrations decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. He will instead be required to respond in writing.\u00a0Rachael Bade reports: Democrats agreed to the billionaires request about his 2018 financial disclosure form that a U.S. government watchdog said violated his ethics agreement, according to correspondence between the two parties obtained by The Washington Post. Ross also tried in recent days to postpone the Oversight hearing to April 9, according to the correspondence. But Oversight investigators responded that the hearing had been scheduled for months and that Ross had plenty of time. -- Republicans voted on party lines to advance Trumps judicial nominee Neomi Rao to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit.\u00a0She once said women could avoid becoming victims of date rape by staying sober. Rao will receive her final confirmation vote today. (HuffPost) -- After much public shaming, paid internships are a reality once again on\u00a0Capitol Hill. Congress approved a maximum monthly salary of $1,800 for interns. Paul Kane reports: Paying interns used to be common practice .... but it turned into an office-by-office decision when funds were cut for deficit reduction. [A] 2017 survey showed that more than 90 percent of House offices did not pay interns, while in the Senate, 51 percent of GOP offices and 31 percent of Democratic ones paid their interns. A year later, sufficiently shamed as cheapskates, Congress bowed to the pressure, approving $14 million as an initial down payment for interns. Anti-Brexit supporters\u00a0take part in a protest outside the House of Parliament in London. (Tim Ireland/AP) -- The British Parliament overwhelmingly rejected Theresa Mays Brexit plan, lowering the chances Britain will leave the European Union on March 29. William Booth and Karla Adam report: Last-minute negotiations with E.U. leaders were not enough to secure the support of hard-liners in the prime ministers Conservative Party 75 Tories voted against their leader. The loss raises questions not only about Mays authority but also about how Britain will exit the trading bloc. With just over two weeks before the Brexit deadline, the options are narrowing. Parliament will vote Wednesday on whether to leave the European Union on schedule, on March 29, without a deal European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters ... that the union was not willing to reopen talks. -- Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's regime in Venezuela announced that opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u00a0is being investigated in connection with possible sabotage of the national electrical system that has left the country in a blackout for nearly a week. Mary Beth Sheridan and Anthony Faiola report: Guaid\u00f3 was already under investigation for violent occurrences in the country since January, when his opposition movement took off. He brushed off the new allegations. We know who is responsible for the tragedy that our country is living, and its Maduro, he said, appearing at anti-government demonstrations around Caracas. Analysts said they doubted that the popular opposition leader would be detained. -- Luis Carlos D\u00edaz, the Venezuelan journalist detained by police on Monday night, was released after being charged with instigating crime. Hes barred from leaving the country without authorization and must show up to court in eight days. Bloombergs Patricia Laya and Jose Orozco report: Diaz was grabbed Monday by intelligence police while biking home from Union Radio, according to his wife. -- A new document reveals\u00a0the Navy and its industry partners are being held under cyber siege by Chinese hackers who have stolen national security secrets by exploiting critical weaknesses in U.S.\u00a0cybersecurity systems. Wall Street Journals Gordon Lubold and Dustin Volz report: The 57-page document is especially scathing in its assessment of how the Navy has addressed cybersecurity challenges facing its contractors and subcontractors, faulting naval officials for not anticipating that adversaries would attack the defense industrial base and for not adequately informing those partners of the cyber threat. It also acknowledges a lack of full understanding about the extent of the damage. -- The AFL-CIO criticized the Green New Deal as not achievable or realistic, which could threaten 2020 Democrats support of the proposal. Colby Itkowitz, Dino Grandoni and Jeff Stein report: Support for the Green New Deal has become a benchmark for Democrats running for president. But the AFL-CIO throwing water on the plan complicates matters for Democrats who rely on labor support. Without the backing from unions or the business community, it will be a hard sell for Democrats to get it beyond grass-roots support. [AFL-CIO leaders] urged the lawmakers to include labor in conversations related to climate change, but they said such work shouldnt impinge on other priorities such as infrastructure. -- Pete Buttigiegs campaign said it saw its biggest fundraising day in the 24 hours after the mayors widely praised CNN town hall. CNNs Dan Merica reports: According to the Buttigieg aide, the mayor raised more than $600,000 from over 22,200 donations in the 24 hours after the CNN town hall. The number is even more significant, the aide said, because the committee employs 20 staffers, lean when compared to other Democratic operations. -- 2020 Democratic candidates are siding with the marijuana industry in the fight for marijuana legislation,\u00a0writes Keith Humphreys:\u00a0Presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has introduced a bill removing marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act, a proposal that has been endorsed by [several] fellow Democratic candidates In a Democratic primary in which most candidates are trying to prove their left-wing credentials, it may be ironic that such a corporate-friendly form of legalization has caught on. But that may be because the implications of the proposal and the less profit-driven legalization alternatives available havent gotten much attention. Descheduling marijuana without conditions provides a handsome taxpayer-funded gift to the for-profit cannabis industry. ....a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history, especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors?

The case was one of several across the country addressing attempts to cut public dollars to Planned Parenthood and other providers who offer abortions in addition to a range of health care services. The 6th Circuit's ruling affects six state public health programs in Ohio, but doesn't touch Medicaid. Four of the 11 Sixth Circuit judges who sided with Ohio in Tuesday's decision were appointed by [Trump].

Chief Executive David Potts said there were signs of a \u201csmall amount\u201d of stockpiling and that Morrisons, Britain\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket group, was well prepared whatever happened in the Brexit process.  With just 16 days to go until it is due to leave the European Union, Britain has still not agreed a withdrawal arrangement, raising the risk of a disorderly \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quite a tick-up in painkillers and toilet rolls (sales) ... up high single digits,\u201d Potts told reporters.  \u201cIn the event of things getting sticky at the ports, we\u2019d look for alternative routes into the country,\u201d he added, saying the company had obtained Authorised Economic Operator status, which should speed-up border checks in the event of hold-ups.  Potts also said the firm had brought forward some purchases of goods and packaging materials to support its manufacturing division, and stockpiled popular \u201ccupboard fillers\u201d.  Morrisons reported a 9 percent rise in underlying pretax profit to 406 million pounds ($533 million) for the year to Feb. 3. That compared with analysts\u2019 average forecast of 407 million pounds and 374 million in 2017-18.  The company, which trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s Asda in annual sales, said total revenue rose 2.7 percent to 17.7 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales up 4.8 percent, though growth did slow in its fourth quarter.  \u201cWe remain confident that Morrisons still has many sales and profit growth opportunities ahead, and expect that growth to be meaningful and sustainable,\u201d the firm said.  Shares in Morrisons, up 6 percent this year prior to the update, were down 1 percent at 0913 GMT.  Potts joined Morrisons in 2015 to lead a recovery after it was hit by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern England heartlands and strategic errors by previous management.  Although the discounters are still winning market share from all of Britain\u2019s big four grocers, Potts has delivered three years of like-for-like sales growth thanks to more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability as well as better customer service in refurbished stores.  He has also overhauled Morrisons\u2019 online strategy through a renegotiated deal with Ocado and struck wholesale supply deals with Amazon, the McColl\u2019s convenience chain, MPK Garages forecourt stores, Channel Islands retailer Sandpiper and Big C in Thailand.  Morrisons is also unique among its major competitors in making half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells. It says two thirds of what it sells is British.

Matt Bevin (R). (Timothy D. Easley/AP) The Trump administration will appear today before a federal judge to defend one of its most consequential and controversial moves on health insurance a green light for states to require their Medicaid enrollees to work or volunteer. And the administrations prospects for success dont look great at this point, considering the judge hearing the oral arguments\u00a0previously called the Department of Health and Human Services arbitrary and capricious for approving work requirements at all. U.S. District Judge Jeb Boasberg, an Obama appointee, will hear two separate but related lawsuits this morning at the federal courthouse in the District. The first is a challenge to Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas, one of just three states that have been allowed to put them into effect so far. The second is a challenge to similar requirements in Kentucky, which Boasberg blocked in June. Expect the arguments to further inflame a passionate debate among lawmakers and health-care advocates about whether the low-income Americans who benefit from the Medicaid program should be required to show that theyve obtained a job or engaged in other approved activities such as volunteering or job training. Whether its legal under federal law for states to impose such requirements is the\u00a0key question at stake here. Opponents of work requirements argue it violates the spirit \u00a0and, in some cases, the text of the Social Security Act, which lays out Medicaid as a medical assistance program. A frontal assault on the objectives of Medicaid is shocking and brazen, Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy for Families USA, told reporters earlier this week. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Medicaid chief Seema Verma claim work requirements are legal because they are aimed at helping people move out of poverty entirely. The agency has approved work requirements for\u00a0seven states that have requested them, although only Arkansas, New Hampshire and Indiana have implemented them so far. Arkansas has become a focal point of the whole debate, as more than 18,000 of the states 234,000 Medicaid enrollees lost coverage last year either for failing to comply with the requirements or for failing to report their compliance to the state. Under the states new rules, beneficiaries lose coverage if they dont meet the requirements for three months within one year. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.)\u00a0speaks on Capitol Hill.\u00a0(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Azar said Tuesday that HHS does not yet have data as to why they fell off the program, when queried about the Arkansas situation by Rep.

In a heated exchange, Kennedy asked Azar why President Trumps budget proposal this week backed enacting work requirements nationwide if it had incomplete data about the effects of the policy. Healthier people working is not the same thing as work making people healthier, Kennedy retorted. The evidence in Arkansas of work requirements causing people to fall off Medicaid could make it even harder for HHS to convince\u00a0Boasberg of the validity of\u00a0its position this time around. In his ruling over summer, the judge said the agency didnt adequately assess the impact of work requirements on enrollment overall. At minimum, the Secretary failed to adequately analyze coverage, Boasberg wrote. There are two basic elements to that problem: First, whether the project would cause recipients to lose coverage. Second, whether the project would help promote coverage. The Secretary, however, neglected both. And theres something else that encourages opponents of work requirements. In November, the nonpartisan panel that advises on Medicaid policy sent HHS a letter urging it to pause Arkansass work requirements until it had taken steps to help enrollees comply. The low level of reporting is a strong warning signal that the current process may not be structured in a way that provides individuals an opportunity to succeed, with high stakes for beneficiaries who fail, wrote Penny Thompson, chairman of the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. The policy, a key effort by\u00a0outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, will limit the sale of fruity and kid-friendly flavors of vaping products to stores that prohibit minors or that have adult-only sections, our\u00a0Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. Online sellers of these products will also have to tighten age verification and limit the quantities that are sold. Any companies that violate these rules will be subject to enforcement actions from the agency, which can include\u00a0stripping their products from the market. Gottlieb had detailed a plan similar to the new draft guidance back in November. Gottlieb also moved up by one year the deadline for flavored e-cigarettes to get agency approval to August 2021, Laurie writes. The sales restrictions and new deadline would apply to a vast array of e-cigarette products, including those offered in flavors such as cherry and bubblegum. They would not apply to mint, menthol and tobacco flavors unless those products were being sold in a way that targeted minors because the agency says those products are most often used by adult smokers trying to quit. OOF: The leader of one\u00a0of the country's largest insurers expressed openness this week to\u00a0Medicare-for-all. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said he views the idea as a potentially enormous opportunity for the health insurance industry, Insider Louisville reports. For me, I think its a great opportunity for the industry to be able to expand the population that its coordinating care with, Broussard said Tuesday at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference in Miami Beach, Fla.\u00a0 But Broussard said he would expect a Medicare-for-all plan to still involve the private sector working in conjunction with the federal government to provide care, comparing it to the way the U.S. manages its space program. And\u00a0he warned that there are big, outstanding questions about how such a system would work\u00a0and who would pay for it. Partnership for America's Health Care Future -- the coalition of industry groups opposing all iterations of Medicare-for-all -- pushed back against Broussard's remarks. OUCH: Nearly 100 countries reported\u00a0marked surges in measles cases last year\u00a0over the previous year, according to a new U.N.\u00a0report. The rise was in part due to complacency among parents and unwarranted concerns about vaccination, the report found. Recent measles outbreaks have also led to questions in countries over the ramifications for families unwilling to vaccinate children, even as most countries say that decision is up to the parents, our Post colleague Rick Noack writes. A law that took effect at the beginning of 2016 in the Australian state of Victoria made vaccinations a condition for the enrollment of children in preschool, he reports. Families unwilling to have their children vaccinated were also refused access to family assistance payments, except if kids were ineligible to receive vaccinations because of allergies. In Europe, Italian lawmakers followed suit in 2017, banning children from nurseries if they had not received a total of 10 mandatory vaccinations and imposing fines on parents of unvaccinated school-age kids. In a sign of how politically divisive the issue remains, the populist Five Star Movement later suspended the rule temporarily. When that suspension order expired this week, hundreds of children were denied access to kindergartens across the country. Critics of these sort of measures say its more important to debunk conspiracy theories\u00a0related to vaccines and raise public awareness to their importance. In Finland, for example, there are no mandatory vaccination policies, but efforts such as vaccination in schools and public awareness campaigns have contributed to immunization rates of 95 to 99 percent. In December, officials in the county at the center of New Yorks worst measles outbreak in decades, were compelled to ban unvaccinated children from going to schools that had vaccination rates lower than 95 percent. Months later, the parents of more than 40 of those children sued the Rockland County health department to get their children back in the classroom. But a federal judge\u00a0rejected that request this week. The parents are calling it an exclusion order that has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm, our Post colleague Reis Thebault reports. U.S. District Court Judge Vincent Briccetti said it wasnt in the public interest to let them go back to class. While no one enjoys the fact that these kids are out of school, these orders have worked,\" said county attorney, Thomas Humbach, in a statement to the local Journal News. \"They have helped prevent the measles outbreak from spreading to this school population. The parents lawyer Michael Sussman told the New York Times: What Rockland County has done is remarkably irrational in every conceivable way. Rockland countys effort is the latest effort that exemplifies concern nationwide over the anti-vaccination movement. At the private Green Meadow Waldorf school, where the kids were banned, the vaccination rate was just 33 percent when the December ban took effect, Reis writes. Since then, the county said it has risen to 56 percent, though a schools spokeswoman told the Times the share was actually 83 percent either way, short of the mandated threshold.  During Azars second day on Capitol Hill this week, Democratic lawmakers spent part of the two-hour hearing grilling him on the administrations family separation policy. We continue to hear reports that family separation is still occurring, despite a judges order to stop it, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee said in her opening statement. We are also learning that it may have started earlier than previously known in July 2017. The administration may have separated thousands more children before Congress and the public learned of this immoral policy. She told Azar his agency is complicit with government-sponsored abuse. When asked by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) about whether there was any funding in the Trump's latest budget request to address the issue of separated children, Azar explained there isnt an ongoing program other than the normal family separations we have because of child welfare done by [The Department of Homeland Security]. We dont have a bigger issue right now in terms of separation; we receive a relatively small number, which are according to standards which are fairly consistent with the long time history of the program, he said.\u00a0He did acknowledge issues with information flows. Thats the biggest issue. I demanded back in June we put a box on the intake form any indication of separation, so theres an easy way to track that thats happened, he said. Weve asked for more information from DHS on any rationale why there was a separation because that can be useful to us. We dont decide or get to veto a separation but that helps us decide whether theres a reunification or sponsorship issue. Azar responded: Let me be very clear theres no dispute between us that children being away from their parents is a bad thing, that it poses mental health issues, he said. Thats why we have encouraged people, do\u00a0not come across the border illegally. Two pharmacy benefit managers have agreed to appear before the Senate Finance Committee early next month, following an invitation from Chairman\u00a0Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and the committees top Democrat, Ron Wyden (Ore.) to five of the country's top pharmacy middlemen who negotiate prices and coverage between insurers and drug makers.\u00a0 Grassley and Wyden sent letters to Cigna, Prime Therapeutics, OptumRx, Humana,\u00a0and CVS Health and CVS Caremark, inviting them to testify in an April 3 committee hearing. It will\u00a0give the PBMs -- often targeted for their confusing role in the drug-pricing chain --\u00a0a chance to defend\u00a0their own role, after lawmakers grilled pharmacutical\u00a0executives in a hearing last month.\u00a0 Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) speaks during a Senate Armed Subcommittee hearing on preventing sexual assault. (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.)\u00a0is asking the Air Force to have a summit on sexual assault in the military.\u00a0The freshman senator, who revealed last week during a congressional hearing that she had been raped by a superior while serving in the Air Force, sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson calling on her to gather with senior leaders and policy experts for a discussion within the next month, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports. I firmly believe that commanders must be fully responsible for preventing and responding to sexual assault in the ranks, she wrote. However, if we truly want to see aggressive change, we must take a fresh look at what else needs to be done in our approach to education, prevention, investigation and prosecution of these crimes.\u00a0\u00a0 She cited statistics from the Department of Defense that found in 2017, 5,277 service members reported being sexually assaulted during their military service. And these were just the women and men who bravely chose to report their assault, McSally wrote to Wilson. This is simply unacceptable. A scientist prepares to inject embryos with Cas9 protein at a lab in Shenzhen, China. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP) \u00a0The National Institutes of Health and a group of scientists and ethicists from seven countries have separately called for a moratorium on gene-editing experiments meant to alter certain heritable traits in babies. The new call for a moratorium is an acknowledgment that the many warnings emerging from conferences on the ethics of gene editing have not been sufficiently clear and emphatic and, in the case of the Chinese twins, have failed to prevent an ethical violation, he adds. Separately, NIH Director Francis Collins issued a statement supporting the call for a moratorium and told The Post this was the position of the federal government\u00a0and was cleared at the highest levels. What were talking about here is one of the most fundamental moments of decision about the application of science to something of enormous societal consequence. Are we going to cross the line toward redesigning ourselves? Collins said. \u00a0The paper in Nature does not call for a permanent ban on gene editing of heritable traits.

Cutting them could lower its earnings by 10% next year. (AAPL)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-03-14T21:17:02Z", "origContent": "Spotify's complaint against Apple over unfair competition could end up costing the iPhone maker billions of dollars.   The streaming music maker's allegations against Apple focus on the way Apple manages the App Store and the fees it charges developers who sell their apps and related items there. The complaint it filed with the European Commission on Wednesday increases the chances that Apple will have to lower its commission rates on app sales, warned financial analysts who cover the company.   If Apple is forced to reduce its rates, it's likely it would only have to cut them by a little, a move the company could easily swallow, said Mark Kelley, an analyst who covers the electronics giant for Nomura Instinet, in a research note on Thursday. But if Apple has to put in place a particularly large cut in its rates \u2014 which would require a \"structural change\" to its commission policies \u2014 the move could cost the company more than $8 billion in lost sales next year and about $1.25 a share in lost earnings, Kelley estimated.   \"A structural change in Apple's take rate seems unlikely, but would prove more damaging\" than a slight change in rates, he said.   Apple charges a 30% commission on most sales through its app store. For subscriptions charged through its store, Apple lowers its cut to 15% after the first year. Combining those two rates, the company on average gets a commission of about 27% on all the sales through the App Store, Kelley said. Google charges similar rates in its Google Play store and sees about the same overall commission rate, he said.  Epic Games, the maker of \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" has been routing around app stores by distributing versions of the game through its website.  And now Spotify has filed a formal complaint with European regulators, asserting in part that the fees Apple charges are unfair and anticompetitive. While it had to pay a 30% fee to Apple on its subscriptions, Apple Music \u2014 the iPhone maker's rival subscription music service \u2014 has to pay no such fees, Spotify charged. To receive the same amount of revenue, Spotify says it would have to increase the cost of its subscription, which it argues harms consumers.   Spotify's complaint comes amid growing scrutiny of the business models of Apple and other tech giants. Just last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that she would seek to bar such companies from both operating a platform or marketplace and offering apps or services on that marketplace that compete with those from third parties.   \"With growing calls from more robust regulation, we continue to view app store pricing as an area that could see more pressure,\" Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, said in a note late Wednesday.   Apple is particularly susceptible to potential changes in app-store fee rates. The company is banking much of its future on growth in its services business. Not only has that segment been growing faster than Apple's overall hardware business, it's more profitable too.  Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, which filed a competition complaint against Apple in Europe on Wednesday. Apple's App Store commissions make up the biggest component of its services business, accounting for about 30% of its total revenue, Kelley estimated. Consumers spent around $47 billion on apps and other items in its store last year, and the iPhone maker pulled in about $12.6 billion in revenue from those sales, Kelley estimated. Both of those figures are about double the comparable ones for Google.   A slight reduction in Apple's App Store rates won't hurt the company very much, Kelley said. If its overall commission rate falls to about 25%, Apple's store revenue next year would be about $1.4 billion less than it would be otherwise, while its earnings per share would be about 20 cents lower, he said. But those hits would represent less than 1% of the company's expected overall revenue next year and only about 1.5% of its expected per-share earnings.   But bigger cuts in its commission rates would lead to much sharper reductions in Apple's expected sales and profits, Kelley said. If its commission rate drops to 20% overall, Apple would take a $5 billion hit to its total sales next year and would see its earnings per share cut by 75 cents, or about 6%, he said. If its fee rate falls to 15%, Apple's overall revenue in 2020 would be cut by 3%, or $8 billion, and its earnings per share would be reduced $1.25, or nearly 10%.   Schachter thinks there's a chance it could fall even further than that, suggesting Apple's commission rate might drop to just 12%. That would cut its earnings before interest and taxes by 15% next year, he said.   \"Pressure on [the] app distribution model [is] building,\" Schachter said.", "tags": ["google play store", "total revenue", "allegations", "complaint", "pressure"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Facebook jumps to its best level in 8 months after a Wall Street bank says the stock is going to get close to its record high (FB)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-stock-price-nomura-says-stock-to-hit-record-2019-3"}, {"title": "Here's why Spotify is declaring war on Apple and not Google (AAPL)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/why-spotify-european-competition-complaint-about-apple-not-google-2019-3"}, {"title": "Spotify's antitrust complaint poses a 'meaningful risk' to Apple and could undermine the App Store and Apple Music (AAPL)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-apple-trust-complaint-risk-2019-3"}]}, {"title": "Tesla: \u201cSurprise! You may not be fired\"", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-03-12T05:00:00Z", "origContent": "When most Americans are fast asleep -- 6am in London -- Tesla pushed out a press release Monday which, to be honest, is pretty sensational, even for a company promising rocket-assisted cars. Last month, we announced that we would be winding down many of our stores and moving to online-only sales in order to pass the savings along to our customers. This was only ten days ago! We feel old. Anyway. On an invite-only media conference call following the original February 28 announcement (we're sure our invite got lost in the post), Elon Musk explained the decision was not just about cost-savings, but also because \u201cit\u2019s 2019. People want to buy things online\u201d. The consumer demanded it, and Tesla was ready to oblige. Who needs to be guided through the process of buying a $35,000 asset anyway? Well it turns out... (emphasis ours): Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months. When we recently closed 10% of sales locations, we selected stores that didn\u2019t invite the natural foot traffic our stores have always been designed for. These are stores that we would have closed anyway, even if in-store sales made up our entire sales model. A few stores in high visibility locations that were closed due to low throughput will be reopened, but with a smaller Tesla crew. In addition, there are another 20% of locations that are under review, and depending on their effectiveness over the next few months, some will be closed and some will remain open. Perhaps it was the real cost of cancelling the leases that did it. According to Tesla\u2019s latest 10-K filing, operating lease obligations amount to $1.6bn over the next five years. While not all related to its stores, even paying off its landlords a quarter of that could be problematic for a company where every dollar of cash flow is crucial. (For more, read this excellent WSJ article from the weekend.) As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. In other words, we will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half. Ah price rises, just a fortnight after cutting prices for all of its cars worldwide. That makes total sense. We\u2019re sure that extra 3 per cent is going to make all the difference to the UK-based, full spec Model X buyers who spent \u00a3137,705 on their cars on February 27, only to find the price drop to \u00a387,200 on March 1. (Numbers courtesy of AutoExpress.) Potential Tesla owners will have a week to place their order before prices rise, so current prices are valid until March 18th. There will be no price increase to the $35,000 Model 3. The price increases will only apply to the more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X. Alphaville is sure this has nothing to do with the fact that most of the expensive variants are likely to be in-stock, and therefore almost sure to be delivered before the quarter-end if ordered this week. To be clear, all sales worldwide will still be done online, in that potential Tesla owners coming in to stores will simply be shown how to order a Tesla on their phone in a few minutes. And the generous return policy of 1000 miles or 7 days, whichever comes first, should alleviate the need for most test drives. However, cars will still be available for test drives at stores at the potential Tesla owner\u2019s request. Stores will also carry a small number of cars in inventory for customers who wish to drive away with a Tesla immediately. Ah, so it turns out customers do like trying-before-they-buy when it comes to the second most expensive purchase of their lifetimes. Who knew? Of course, returning a car after 1,000 miles may be tricky if there's so few stores to return it to. But we digress. While these numbers may strike our readers as very low, we also note reduced US sales estimates from Inside EVs, a trade website Mr Musk tweeted last summer, when the site reported impressive market share figures for the Model 3. It estimates Tesla sold 12,250 Model 3s and 3,725 Model S/Xs through February. However, it's important to highlight that Tesla has made a sustained effort to ship cars to Europe and Asia this quarter, so this could explain the reported drop in US sales. But if Mr Chowdhry is close to correct, then his research may explain the seemingly rushed nature of Tesla's sales strategy.  Think about it this way: when it comes to mistakes, growth companies have it easy. Rocketing revenues can often mask underperforming segments, or bad investment decisions, thanks to the mollifying nature of rising positive cash flows. Just think how easily Amazon recovered from the debacle of the Fire Phone, for example. When the music stops, however, the reverse is equally true. Unexpectedly slow growth means once trivial issues can become acute problems. And, in an effort to maintain profits, companies often rush to hasty strategic decisions.

Now they're looking north again.", "source": "the-washington-post", "date": "2019-03-15T17:27:00Z", "origContent": "NACIMIENTO DE LOS NEGROS, Mexico Their ancestors were African Americans who escaped from the United States to Mexico in the 19th century, fleeing the slave trade for a desert village at the base of the Sierra Madre mountains. They were called the Mascogos, roughly 60 black families who spoke and prayed in English as they hid from the white men who wanted to put them back in shackles.  That was six generations ago. Since then, their English vocabulary has dissipated, replaced by the Spanish of Northern Mexico. Droughts destroyed their farms. Drug cartels have inched closer to their village, whose name translates literally as Birth of the Blacks. Now members of this community of 300 are heading back to the United States. Its another vector in a history of migration, sometimes voluntary, sometimes forced, from slave ships across the Atlantic to the cross-border scramble for 21st-century jobs. At a time of unprecedented debate over immigration, and the current surge in border crossings, the history of the Mascogos reflects the long view on human migration, the way a community can be pushed and pulled across borders over centuries, eventually returning to the place from which they fled. Their relationship with the United States is fraught, but their reason for returning both legally and illegally is not unique: Theyre looking for work. Dramatic droughts have desiccated the corn and bean farms of Mexicos northern Coahuila state. More than half the villages livestock have died. Where there are agriculture jobs, they pay just a few dollars a day. New factory jobs in Mexico are hours away, and dont pay much more. This week, Vazquez waspacking her bags for West Texas, where shes been hired to clean a ranch house in the town of Fort Stockton. She has received a temporary work visa. She expects to earn about $10 per hour. [The U.S. sends thousands of deportees each month to Mexicos most dangerous border areas] That was a different time, Vazquez said. Yes, it makes us sad, but its over. There is work in the United States, and I have no problem crossing the border to do it. Other Mascogos have made deals with their children: They can work in the United States, but they must not settle there. Thats the agreementthat one of Vazquezs cousins, Julio Cesar Salazar, made with his five kids, two of whom are now in the United States. Vazquez, like the rest of the Mascogos, grew up vaguely aware of her communitys circuitous trajectory through history. The village celebrated Juneteenth, the holiday on June 19 that commemorates the abolition of slavery in the United States. Women wore dresses that had changed little from the Antebellum South. Her grandmother, Lucia Vazquez Valdez, still sings hymns in English; she attached her familys American name, Payne, to her Mexican one. The Mascogos descend from slaves who escaped from plantations in the American South during the 17th and 18th centuries. They fled first to Florida, which was then owned by the Spanish, who generally allowed escaped slaves to live as free men and women. Some lived alongside members of the Seminole tribe and eventually became known as Black Seminoles or, in Spanish, Mascogos. The United States took control of Florida in 1821. Nine years later, President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which forced native tribes in the Southeast, including the Mascogos, along the Trail of Tears, to Oklahoma. That move made them once again vulnerable to Southern slaveholders. So in July 1850, 309 Mascogos escaped to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished decades earlier, crossing the border near what is now Eagle Pass, Tex. They settled in Nacimiento, in the state of Coahuila. But many returned to work as Indian Scouts for the United States, defending military installations in Texas from other tribes. In exchange, the Mascogos were offered land and citizenship in America, a pledge that apparently dissolved at the end of the 19th century. For much of the 20th century, the Mascogos lived and farmed in Nacimiento, a two-hour drive from Eagle Pass. But by the 1990s, it had become increasingly clear that the job prospects in the United States were better. For a lot of the Mascogos, they dont look to the United States as a place where they were enslaved, but as a place they were able to escape as free people, a place they can now freely choose to return to. Its a narrative of resilience and strength, said Rocio Gil, who is completing her PhD dissertation on the group at the City University of New York. [Migrants will wait in Mexico while the U.S. processes asylum claims. Thats a dangerous proposition.] Some got tourist visas and overstayed them. Others took the short swim across the Rio Grande. Starting in 1999, Servando Cervantes crossed the border illegally once a year to work on farms. Eventually, he says, he secured permanent residence. He thought about what it meant to return to a country that had enslaved his ancestors. He didnt see the choice as a moral dilemma it was strictly economic. Im not going to blame a child for the sins of his father, he said. Hes back living in Nacimiento now. He says he lost his green card and was deported a few years ago, after being arrested for fighting in a bar. Now he watches as neighbors leave the village, one by one,to join what has become a torrent of migration. Some are farmworkers who save up to $2,000 to pay smugglers to get them over the border. Some are students at John Horse Secondary School, named after the Mascogo who led the group to Mexico in 1850. Enrique Salazar, a 17-year-old senior in a New York Yankees shirt, said: As soon as I get the chance to go to the U.S., Im out of here. I care about the culture of our tribe, but I also need to make some money. A neighboring tribe with historic ties to the United States and Mexico, the Kickapoo, has been granted citizenship in both countries. The Mascogos have made several attempts, but so far have not been recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. A feud with the Seminoles, who argue that Black Seminoles arent genuine members of the tribe, has made their chances of securing U.S. citizenship unlikely. People here estimate that roughly half the village has moved to the United States, leaving an eerie quiet over the few paved streets. Half-built houses stand unfinished, awaiting more remittances. There are pickups with Texas license plates, lawn mowers purchased at Home Depot, clotheslines with Walmart T-shirts. This place is emptying out, said Evangelina Barnes, 50, a Mascogo who was born in Nacimiento but now lives in San Antonio. This week, Barnes was one of several Mascogos back from the United States for a visit. Corina Harington, 45, was a small child in the 1980s when her father took their family from Nacimiento across the border to San Antonio. Shes lived there since, now as a U.S. citizen. Last week, she was back in the village with her cousin, Dina Rodriguez, also a Mascogo, who lives in Lubbock, Tex. I understand why they want to migrate, Harrington said. I love this place, but the fact is, theres really not much here. This is not an easy place to make a living anymore. During their visit, Harrington and Rodriguez sat down with Lucia Vazquez Valdez, the oldest living Mascogo. At 86, Valdez is blind and has difficulty hearing. She remembers little of the English her parents and grandparents spoke fluently. But, like magic, she can sing the English words to the hymns and gospels her ancestors once sang. This week, Rodriguez and Harrington sang with her, recording videos on their phones.

Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Tesla is finally putting the Y in sexy\u00a0 or rather S 3 X Y \u00a0\u00a0its lineup of car models. The electric car maker is\u00a0unveiling its new Model Y crossover SUV at Thursday at 8 p.m. Pacific Time in Los Angeles. I would be lying if I said I didn't find it alluring. I have long lusted with a protective detachment after the sleek cars that seemed the elusive and unattainable thing I could only\u00a0dream\u00a0about. And yes, I'll be watching the unveiling of Tesla's newest addition. But it won't be with my face longingly pressed up against the screen\u00a0 this time, it will be as a Tesla owner. Just less than three months ago, my husband and I got our his-and-hers Model 3s for Christmas, fulfilling his dream to prove me wrong. (When he pitched the idea when the Model 3 was first announced, I told him he was kidding. It wasn't a question.)\u00a0 Initially an experience reserved for the luxury buyer, owning a Tesla is now comparable to a higher-end\u00a0Honda Civic. At least for when it comes to the Model 3. Pricing for the Model Y hasn't been announced. Nearly three years ago, Tesla CEO and evangelist Elon Musk unveiled the long-awaited affordable Tesla, the Model 3, promising a base price of $35,000. Hundreds of thousands rushed to pay $1,000 deposits. Last year, the Model 3 arrived, but at prices far from that more affordable range. Fans who had waited so long felt this was a bait-and-switch. But the promise is finally being fulfilled, with Tesla announcing at the end of February it finally is selling a standard model with slightly less range (220 miles) and fewer frills for $35,000, with deliveries starting soon. We were totally the target market for this car, but we didn't wait for it. We couldn't. With tax incentives expiring at the end of 2018 and still no entry-level Model 3,\u00a0we replaced my leased Hyundai Sonata and his 14-year-old Acura TL with\u00a0Mid-Range Model 3s that can travel up to 260 miles on a full charge. My husband did have to literally pull me into the storefront at the mall, as I babbled about how we were being irresponsible parents about to borrow $48,000 times two\u00a0 even if we were getting $10,000 in tax incentives back, times two. My initial hyperventilation aside, buying a Tesla was unlike any other car-buying experience Ive ever had. The showroom was barely a storefront. People were milling about, climbing in and out of the cars. There were three different models on display, minimalist decor and maybe three computers in the back. No salespeople the representatives were there to offer a test drive, answer questions or help walk us through the online purchase process. Since then the\u00a0company has said that its going to scale back its physical stores and put more emphasis on online sales. Not once did anyone say \"Let me talk to my manager.\" This was a marked difference from the experience we had a few years ago leasing a Nissan Leaf, also a fully electric vehicle. The paperwork alone took hours. Paperwork for Tesla was emailed before delivery. Still, we had a long wait for our vehicles.\u00a0 Michelle Maltais picked up her Tesla Model 3 from a nearby distribution center and drove off after a quick lesson from a Tesla rep. In Los Angeles where we live, Model 3s are everywhere\u00a0like Toyota Priuses were in their earlier days. I almost imagine the Model S and Xs thinking, there goes the neighborhood with all the newer, cheaper models now flooding the streets.\u00a0 Like the very first iPhone forever changed what I knew as a phone, this car Ive been driving for more than a couple of months now has changed my experience with and expectations for something I've known my entire life driving a car. For instance, it can technically drive itself. More on that later.\u00a0 The Model 3, like its higher-priced siblings, is slick and intuitive. Driving is customizable, from how the car brakes and accelerates to how it maneuvers the roads. Operating the vehicle is as easy as tapping a screen, literally. And from my phone, I can lock and unlock\u00a0the doors, open the trunks, can set speed limits and control the temperature in the car, among other things.\u00a0 Weve become a society that taps and swipes their way through communication and activities. Why shouldnt driving a car mirror that? But then there's also the humor and the fun.\u00a0My husband and I stole a quiet moment together with the car's\u00a0\u00a0\"Romance Mode,\"\u00a0its heat gently blowing and crackling fire video,\u00a0while we parked at the beach. We did it in \"parent mode\" aka kids asleep in the back. The whole experience reminds me of Apple iPhone's early days all the way from the paradigm-shifting form and function of technology to geeking out with other Tesla\u00a0fans and owners to the recent price drops and high-excitement unveilings. Now, though,\u00a0frustration and resentment are rising themes expressed in several posts in Facebook groups and on Reddit. The primary complaint: owners are less than thrilled about dramatic price drops on cars they ecstatically dropped $10,000 more on only a few months earlier. But back to the car. There are\u00a0challenges, some\u00a0we hadnt thought of. The compact legroom in the backseat means I will always be a driver or riding shotgun. There is also the minor inconvenience of, say, the seatbelt latch in the back being difficult to reach from a child's booster seat.\u00a0 Then there was the time I didn't remember that I needed\u00a0to leave\u00a0my\u00a0Tesla keycard or my mobile phone with my husband when he dropped me off with the kids and drove away. We learned the hard way when the kids and I\u00a0went to the YMCA while my husband drove off to a nearby Wendy's. The car continued to drive without issue. But once he put it in park and hopped out, he was stuck with a car he couldn't figure out how to\u00a0operate without either the keycard or my phone. An $8 Uber ride later, we figured out that I could have started the car remotely from the Tesla app on my phone. Lesson learned. Yes, the over-the-air updates to the car's software are incredibly convenient and exciting. I do love that, overnight, my car got a brand new security feature called Sentry Mode, capitalizing on the cameras all over the car and the ability to record to USB drive. And some of the other improvements have been amazing\u00a0to me. I mean, I went to sleep with a car outside that does 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds. In the morning, I walked out to one that does 0 to 60 in 5.2 seconds and now has a range of 264 miles instead of 260. All with an over-the-air update, just like my smartphone. Still, as with any computer, sometimes there are glitches. On the rare occasions the screens have gone black while driving, sure, thats startling. But the car kept moving, thankfully. I mentioned earlier that the car can drive itself. This isn't news to most, but its really quite stunning experiencing it in action.\u00a0 But looking practically, the way anyone driving the car would, the daggone car drives itself!\u00a0Thats not to say its perfect. But the people who use it regularly do tend to gush. I took advantage of the 30-day trial that was offered with my car. On a long road trip from L.A. to Las Vegas, with hands on the wheel ready to take over, I let my car drive me. While it was incredibly smooth and generally reliable even for car-initiated lane changes in freeway traffic, there were\u00a0disturbing moments. One was when the car needed to make a pit stop to recharge vacillated twice between making a move to\u00a0exit and staying in the lane. The other was when the car straddled lanes as it guided itself from one freeway to the next. Thankfully, no one else was on the onramp at the time. Autopilot also couldn't\u00a0yet recognize stop lights and occasionally got confused by poorly marked lanes. FSD didnt always feel ready for prime time, or for me to drop up to $7,000 for the\u00a0upgrade. (Tesla had since dropped the price to $5,000. But, amid vocal frustration from owners who paid more for the feature, the company is raising it back again March 18.)\u00a0 With the lower-tier Autopilot feature\u00a0 with auto steering, accelerating and braking\u00a0 going for $2,000 until MondayI have been tempted to spring for it.

In the interview, Razek, the 70-year-old chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, said that he didn't think the lingerie brand's annual fashion show should feature \"transsexuals\" because \"the show is a fantasy.\"   Business Insider spoke to four former Victoria's Secret executives who held longtime positions at the company but wished to remain anonymous in order to speak frankly about their time there. Three of these executives were based in the New York office. The fourth requested full anonymity.   These former employees said that based on their experience working there, there is no real debate as to whether Razek would have stepped down. They said that he has full control over the creative vision of the brand and is considered to be the closest confidant of Les Wexner, CEO and founder of parent company L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works and Pink in addition to Victoria's Secret.   Former executives said that in their experience, Razek and Wexner had an \"unshakable\" view of how the company's image should be projected and were extremely resistant to change. And, ultimately, this attitude could be responsible for the brand's current sales slump.  Kendall Jenner at Victoria's Secret 2018 runway show.  Razek joined the company in 1983 as vice president of marketing for Limited Stores. In 1993, he became vice president, director of marketing for Limited, Inc., working directly with Wexner across all of the parent company's retail businesses, including Victoria's Secret. L Brands acquired the lingerie brand in 1982.   Razek has been responsible for organizing Victoria's Secret annual fashion show since 1995 and became chief marketing officer of L Brands in the late 1990s, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.   Both Wexner and Razek work in the company's head office in Columbus, Ohio. The former executives who spoke with Business Insider interacted with the two men in regular conference calls, meetings, and during visits to the Columbus office.   \"Ed ... is just very untouchable in Les' eyes,\" a former executive who worked at Victoria's Secret's New York office for nine years and was laid off in mid-2017 told Business Insider.   \"He considers Ed to be like a brainchild of the brand with him,\" they continued. \"He is the golden child and does whatever he wants.\"   The Wexner/Razek duo has undoubtedly been successful. Victoria's Secret dominated the US lingerie market for years, and Razek was considered one of the most influential people in modeling throughout the early 2000s, helping to launch the careers of household names such as Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Tyra Banks, and Heidi Klum.   The former executives who spoke with Business Insider said that working at Victoria's Secret was considered to be the job in lingerie, and there was always a feeling that they were very lucky to be there.   But as the industry evolved, critics say that Victoria's Secret did not, and according to these former executives, who cited experiences they had while working there, it's because these two men were resistant to changing things.  The idea of the Victoria's Secret \"Angel\" came into play in 1997 after a commercial featuring Helena Christensen, Karen Mulder, Daniela Petov\u00e1, Stephanie Seymour, and Tyra Banks ran to promote its \"Angels\" underwear collection.  These two men have a specific view of what makes a woman sexy, another former employee who worked in a senior management role at Victoria's Secret for over a decade and was also made redundant, told Business Insider.   \"[They] have an unshakable point of view as to how that brand should be projected,\" this former executive said. \"They don't want it to change.\"   This has also made it difficult for other company leaders to make their mark, these former executives said, which could be why there has been frequent turnover within the company's management team.   When Sharen Turney, the longtime CEO of Victoria's Secret, left abruptly in 2016, the business was split into three\u2014 Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty, and Pink \u2014 and each division had its own CEO. The most recent CEO of Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Jan Singer, stepped down after two years in the role in November and was replaced by John Mehas, former president of Tory Burch.   Pink CEO Denise Landman retired at the end of last year and has been replaced by Amy Hauk, former head of merchandising and product development at Bath & Body Works.   \"There was an understanding that Les Wexner was the founder and it is his company; he is the biggest shareholder,\" another former longtime executive told Business Insider. \"I think that is why there is new leadership every three years because people are hopeful that they have more of a say than they do.\"   Other company leaders were often blamed for sales problems when a lot of it was due to the vision of the brand not being current, this former executive said, adding: \"The vision of perfection is owned by Ed and Les.\"   Earlier this month, the CEO of Barington Capital Group, which is a shareholder in L Brands, wrote a fiery letter to Wexner urging him to, among other things, update the brand's image and switch up its predominantly male board of directors.   Barington CEO James A. Mitarotonda called out the lack of diversity on L Brands' board and said that since the majority of the board also has ties to the Wexner family, they could not be seen as truly \"independent\" voices.   \"The existence of these social and business relationships raises serious questions as to the true independence of these directors,\" the letter said.   Barington recommended that Wexner not only switch up the board, but also step down from his dual role of both chairman and CEO to take on just one of those positions.   Razek was also called out in the shareholder letter.   \"In our view, Mr. Razek has done a poor job of stewarding Victoria's Secret's brand by failing to communicate a compelling, up-to-date image that resonates with today's consumers,\" Mitarotonda wrote.   He added: \"While we recognize that Victoria's Secret cannot be all things to all people, we believe that the Company should be delivering a more inclusive marketing message that promotes a more expansive view of beauty.\"   Mitarotonda referenced the success of American Eagle's Aerie brand, which recently reported its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Starting in 2014, the brand has swapped out airbrushed ads for unretouched photos and launched a body-positive campaign known as #AerieReal.  My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive. I apologize. To be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show. We've had transgender models come to castings And like many others, they didn't make itBut it was never about gender. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.  Jeremy Robinson-Leon, a crisis management expert at Group Gordon, told Business Insider that there is precedent for leaders stepping down after making similarly controversial remarks.   Robinson-Leon said that a company's decision to ask an executive or someone who is a voice of the brand to step down in these situations often depends on how seriously it is treating the issue.   This adds weight to the recent criticism that Victoria's Secret is behind the times, according to Robinson-Leon.   \"Any person who makes a statement like that does not have a place in 2019,\" he said.   But there's no cut-and-dry solution here. The late Karl Lagerfeld, for example, was known for making controversial remarks and keeping his job.   Lululemon founder Chip Wilson famously made remarks about the brand's leggings not being suitable for larger women after customers complained that the material was pilling in 2013. A month after this interview, Wilson resigned as chairman but stayed on as a member of the board of directors. He left the company altogether two years after that.   Former Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries is another example of this. In 2013, a 2006 interview in which Jeffries said that the brand goes after \"attractive\" and \"cool\" kids resurfaced and caused controversy.   \"A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong,\" he said.   Jefferies was stripped of his role as chairman of Abercrombie's board of directors in January 2014. He stepped down as CEO at the end of that year.   The fact that Razek didn't leave \"speaks to the core of the company,\" Gabriella Santaniello, analyst and founder of retail research firm A Line Partners, told Business Insider. A Line Partners provides in-depth information on brands to investors. Santaniello has worked in the retail consultancy field for over 10 years.   \"It just reaffirms what everyone has been thinking: they are out of touch,\" she said.\"It has shown up in their sales for years.\"   Same-store sales at Victoria's Secret have dropped for the past three years, and last month, the brand announced it would be closing as many as 53 stores this year, citing a \"decline in performance.\" It projected that its square footage in North America would decline by about 3%.   Santaniello said that the company's woes stem from having Wexner at the helm.   \"He needs to retire,\" she said.   Wexner is often considered one of the most successful businessmen in the US. He is worth more than $6.3 billion and has worked his way up from running a small store in downtown Columbus to owning and founding L Brands, one of the largest retail corporations in the US.   However, he's also the longest standing CEO of any Fortune 500 company.   In a rare interview with the Financial Times last year, Wexner said that the typical lifespan of a fashion business is 15 years. He's been at the helm of L Brands for 56 years.   But, some of Victoria's Secret's critics say this is exactly what the brand has failed to do.   \"The sad part about the brand is that they have this beautiful heritage, they created the angels, they made the whole supermodel explosion and there is a rich history, but they don't know how to evolve the brand to what is happening to us as a culture,\" the former executive who worked at Victoria's Secret for nine years said.   \"I think that will be the death of them in the end,\" he said.

In this case it was a hot spot. The University of South Carolina Aiken baseball team was riding home from Dahlonega on Sunday, after its series with the University of North Georgia, when the team's charter bus caught fire in Greene County. All 38 passengers got out of the bus in time and weren't hurt. Everyone got home safely. But some of the team's equipment (and) a lot of players' personal items went up in smoke - including the uniforms that players wore that day, catcher's gear and about a dozen or so baseball gloves. Apparently unfazed, the team held a light practice Monday, and the Pacers' Wednesday night game vs. Erskine College is going forward as planned. Meanwhile, offers of assistance have been pouring in from all over. \"What's so amazing is how many people around the country are offering to help us. I've had calls from all over the country today, and emails and text messages,\" USC Aiken baseball coach Kenny Thomas said Monday. \"The community's been unbelievably supportive trying to help us.\" Coach Thomas said he hadn't seen anything like that fire in at least 32 years of riding buses. We wrote in this space just the other day about Richmond County school bus drivers' complaints concerning on-the-job safety including incidents when two school buses caught fire in less than a week last October. Of course those buses are different yellow school buses, as opposed to motor coaches with comfier seats and DVD players but the safety concerns certainly are the same. That means the solutions are pretty much the same, too. For now, diligent troubleshooting and other preventive measures certainly are the best methods to reduce the chances of a bus fire breaking out. But the age of a bus fleet is another factor that's not always so easily fixable. Just like most of us can't buy ourselves new cars whenever we want, governments and businesses that oversee bus fleets can't always swap out old buses when desired, or even needed. So, old buses are pressed into service for longer periods, which increases chances for accidents. Incidents such as the Pacers' bus fire present clear opportunities for motor coach and bus rental companies and local-government transportation directors, to take closer and more frequent looks at bus safety. Accidents happen. But safety is up to us. Local community leaders made a \"big ask\" with their bold $234 million request to the state for a Savannah Convention Center expansion. The state seems poised to say yes provided Savannah officials acquiesce to a \"big ask\" from the governor's office: Shared control. The Georgia House of Representative passed a resolution Thursday that would dissolve the existing Georgia International and Maritime Trade Center Authority and create a new one called the Savannah-Georgia Convention Center Authority. The maneuver is about much more than a name change, however, as the bill also alters the board's governance, specifically who appoints the members. Currently, all 12 board members are appointed locally, either by members of the Savannah-area lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol or Chatham County and City of Savannah elected officials. Under the new arrangement, the Savannah-Georgia Convention Center Authority board would consist of 11 members, with the governor appointing six and local state lawmakers three. The other two seats are reserved for the leaders of the Savannah Economic Development Authority and Visit Savannah as ex-officio board members with full voting privileges. The message is clear: If Savannah wants the state to foot the bill for a convention center expansion, the price is a controlling interest in facility decision making. It would be easy for Savannah officials to take umbrage with the plot twist in this saga. Savannah and Chatham County have invested $155 million in the convention center since 1993. We built the facility, nurtured it and made it a draw for visitors and all their dollars 4 percent of which goes directly back to the state in taxes, translating to tens of millions of dollars. The indirect economic impact on the state treasury is significant as well. Because the state's interest in the Savannah Convention Center will greatly increase with such a large investment. Gov. Kemp is just two months into his tenure and is exerting his influence in various ways across the state not unusual for a new leader. Board appointments would give the governor a say in how the authority and facility are managed. The current convention center board includes members who have been in their posts since inception, including longtime chairman Mark V. Smith. Many were involved in lobbying Kemp first as a candidate, then as governor-elect and finally as governor on the expansion. Additionally, the board hires and fires the facility manager and by extension the operations staff. Regardless of the motives, Kemp and state officials are making a move on the current authority and the Savannah Convention Center in order to pave the way for the state's investment. To fight this effort now would all but guarantee the end of state support. The resolution currently sits with the State Senate. Our two senators, Ben Watson and Lester Jackson, have hinted at tweaking the legislation's language but are inclined to support the measure and push for passage. From there, only Gov. Kemp could stop it. And he won't, so long as the Senate's alterations don't go too far. Those who oppose the quasi-takeover have only one viable alternative to achieving the expansion financing it locally. Just as city and county taxpayers dedicated significant dollars to establish the convention center, they could do so again. A penny sales tax vote is scheduled for November, and the project list has yet to be finalized. This editorial board discourages this tactic. We recommend local officials work with Sens. Jackson and Watson and Kemp's team to find an acceptable solution on governance. That could be as simple as increasing the size of the board to allow our local state legislators, the Chatham County Commission or the Savannah City Council to appoint members. Expanding the Savannah Convention Center is an economic development priority. Make it happen. Government entities distribute information in a variety of ways in today's media landscape. They still send traditional press releases to media outlets like The Times. They also post on social media, do podcasts and provide videos of public meetings. During \"Sunshine Week,\" when newspapers across the country celebrate the laws that provide some transparency in government, we'd like to applaud our local governments for their efforts to inform the public. One of those laws requires governments to publicize when officials are gathering to meet and unless they're discussing real estate acquisition, personnel or litigation, the meetings are open to the public. Hall County and Gainesville governments have increased access to those meetings by providing video recordings of them on social media and their websites. Though the public access channel TV18 closed at the end of 2018, online videos arguably provide easier access to those interested in following an issue. Online videos are continuously available rather than aired at specific times. Several local government entities have considered using technology such as Facebook Live to stream meetings as they are happening. Hall County Schools has even tried it a few times, though it noted that interest from the public was low. Despite low interest, we'd like to see local governments pursue this option. It requires a cellphone, a charging cord, access to WiFi and a tripod. Quality, as noted by Hall school officials, can be questionable, and additional equipment may improve the sound and visuals. But in an age where anyone can whip out a cellphone and hit record, it makes sense to take this step. It's a low investment to dramatically increase the public's access to the information in a transparent way. Facebook is not the solution to problems of open governments, though. Last week, The Times published an article about the failed tests and another on the materials that were to blame. This story developed from a tip made to The Times and a request for information from the DOT. When information was not readily available, The Times filed an open records request with the DOT. Open records requests are made frequently by newspapers to obtain information that governments do not always provide otherwise. The laws allow average residents and the media to access public information that might otherwise not be made available. In the case of the Exit 14 bridge, The Times is paying $187.91 to receive 820 pages related to the new interchange. Look for another story this week once those documents have been received. The public deserves to know when a bridge funded by taxpayer dollars has failed tests. Open records laws ensure they have access to the information. In another recent open records request made by The Times, the newspaper learned the details of Gainesville officials' decision to spend $10 million in public funds for land at the midtown end of the pedestrian bridge over Jesse Jewell Parkway. In both of these as well as other cases, once the records have been requested, local government officials take the time to speak with reporters, adding context to the documents. It's usually helpful background to explain what the documents show. But words from government officialdom are no substitute for the actual documents, which are proof of what those government employees are actually up to and motivation for the governments to address issues they might prefer to sweep under the rug. Those stories are but two examples of the many occasions The Times has used existing state and federal laws to obtain information on behalf of the general public. It's part of what we do. The various laws dealing with making public records available and holding open government meetings are collectively called \"sunshine laws,\" as in allowing the sun to shine into government operations for all to see what is done. Georgia's version of Sunshine Laws are much stronger than they were a couple of decades ago, but still not as strong as they could be. At that, they are better than what is found in many other states. The annual Sunshine Week recognition is meant to be a reminder of how important those laws are, and of the need to be vigilant in making sure attempts to weaken them are not successful. And while the news media is behind the Sunshine Week recognition, it is important to realize that these laws are not written for the benefit of the media.

U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in January, climbing 0.2 percent, according to the Commerce Department. However, data for December was revised down to show retail sales tumbling 1.6 percent instead of the 1.2 percent previously reported. For Jerry Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, it illustrates the divergence in the industry. While a number of companies have gone out of business or closed stores, results from big retailers like Walmart, Target, Costco and Amazon have been \"superb.\" \"The gap between the winners and the losers is growing,\" he said on \"The Exchange.\" While the numbers from the government were down for December, Mastercard SpendingPulse showed growth in the 4 percent range through the holidays, said Steve Sadove, former CEO Saks Fifth Avenue and a senior advisor for Mastercard. He believes overall retail is \"very healthy.\" Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board research firm, fell in November and December, as stocks tanked, as well as in January, thanks to uncertainty about the partial government shutdown. However, it rebounded in February. \"The consumer was incredibly strong last year. There's no doubt there's been some weakening but she's still there and she's still shopping,\" he said.

This choice may have come in response to heightened antitrust scrutiny from politicians that the company's been experiencing recently. For example, Senator Richard Blumenthal asked the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the requirements for possible antitrust violations in December.   And 2020 Presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Congress should pass a law preventing large companies from owning a marketplace and selling on it simultaneously. The fact that Amazon dropped this pricing parity requirement for merchants on its marketplace in the EU due to regulatory pressure in 2013 further suggests that the prospect of regulation was the reason for its repeal in the US.   This pricing parity requirement gave Amazon a subtle but profound degree of control over the e-commerce market. The size of Amazon's marketplace, combined with a pricing parity requirement, meant that the best Amazon's competitors could do was offer the same price as the e-commerce giant on a number of products.   Furthermore, if Amazon were to raise a fee that caused a seller to elevate the price of a product on its platform, the change could ripple across competing marketplaces because the seller would theoretically have to update its prices on other platforms to achieve parity.   Terminating this policy removes this major advantage for Amazon and could alter the e-commerce landscape as the e-tailer loses its iron grip on minimum prices for many products.   This change will be liberating for merchants, which will gain more control over their pricing when selling beyond Amazon. Third-party sellers will now be able to set pricing on a more case-by-case basis across the different platforms they choose to sell on, as opposed to having to adhere to a minimum that matches their Amazon price. This could encourage merchants to sell on more marketplaces, potentially leading them to a lower degree of dependence on Amazon, a major shift given that a solid 44% of brands say they get more than half of their e-commerce sales through the e-tailer.   Marketplaces that compete with Amazon will now have a chance to gain an advantage. Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the end of Amazon's price parity practice will be competing marketplaces, as they're getting a much better shot at outpricing the e-commerce giant than they previously had. For instance, if one of Amazon's competitors can make it cheaper for a seller to operate on its platform than it would be to sell on Amazon, that merchant can now consider selling at a more competitive price with that marketplace, giving it an edge on Amazon. If Amazon's competitors can employ this strategy with major brands selling on their marketplaces and Amazon's, it could start to cause subtle shifts in the US e-commerce competitive landscape.

In fact, it has been a banner, multibillion-dollar week for Latin American business generally.\u00a0 Mercado Libre, the Argentina-based e-commerce retailer, raised $1.9bn in a share placement and a direct investment from PayPal. SoftBank, the freewheeling conglomerate best-known for its\u00a0$100bn Vision Fund, meanwhile said it was setting up a $5bn Latin America tech fund.\u00a0For outside investors, the region is increasingly no longer a story about commodities only. Just ask China: it has invested more than $100bn in the region since 2005, with most of the deal-flow now into sectors such as tech, communications, alternative energy and finance. Why the sudden rush into tech?\u00a0Well, for one thing, it\u2019s not so sudden. Music-streaming service\u00a0Spotify cut its teeth in Latin America \u2014 in fact, it is the only emerging market where its model worked meaningfully. WhatsApp use is ubiquitous across the region. Brazil is Uber\u2019s largest market outside the US, and Facebook\u2019s third-largest market worldwide. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Latin America is at a tipping point in terms of e-commerce growth,\u201d Sean Summers, Mercado Libre\u2019s chief marketing officer, said of the share placement. SoftBank feels the same. \u201cThere is so much innovation and disruption taking place in the region, and I believe the business opportunities have never been stronger,\u201d said Marcelo Claure, the former Sprint turnround executive who will lead the SoftBank fund. Such boosterish talk always accompanies megadeals. This time it may even be true. Technological change is accelerating, as it is everywhere. Brazilian cosmetics company Natura, for example, now organises its sales reps using Uber-style apps. I\u2019ve heard more than one Venezuelan refugee give thanks for Waze and ride-hailing apps as they help them start new lives in new countries. As this change accelerates, so does deal-flow. To cite just three recent examples, Colombian last-mile delivery company\u00a0Rappi\u00a0has raised funds from investors including Sequoia Capital; Brazilian fintech\u00a0Nubank\u00a0raised $180m from China\u2019s\u00a0Tencent;\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, in its first Latin American acquisition, recently acquired Mexican delivery start-up Cornershop for $225m.\u00a0 However, SoftBank, which is not known for being either soft or slow, has bigger sums to spend. That potentially makes it less agile. Latin America also still has relatively few attractive companies operating across multiple countries to invest in.\u00a0Novam Portam, the Asia-Latin American consultancy, even wonders: \u201cWill SoftBank have the patience to do the diligence required? Or will the headline $5bn not get put to work?\u201d In a possibly fatal blow to Colombia\u2019s peace process, President Iv\u00e1n Duque objected to six items in the accord and asked Congress to change them. The move may be\u00a0unconstitutional, because the law has already been approved by the Constitutional Court. Duque was elected last year on a platform of \u201cimproving\u201d the peace deal.  Seven people died after two masked men armed with a gun, knives, axes and crossbows descended on a S\u00e3o Paulo school and unleashed a mass killing spree that recalled similar incidents in the US but which are rare in Brazil, despite its high homicide rates.

Known for selling wicker chairs and scented candles, Pier 1 has suffered financial losses amid an increasingly competitive retail landscape dominated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc.  Pier 1, which has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada, has added debt restructuring specialists at Kirkland & Ellis LLP to a roster of advisers counseling the chain as it explores strategic alternatives, the sources said.  Pier 1 is also taking meetings with investment bankers who have debt restructuring expertise as it weighs options, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the company\u2019s deliberations are confidential. As of December, the company had about $200 million in long-term debt. Pier 1 has a market capitalization of $90 million.  The engagement of Kirkland & Ellis restructuring lawyers, who typically work on significant bankruptcies and other financial workouts, marks a new chapter in Pier 1\u2019s turnaround efforts after previous initiatives failed to bear fruit.  However, a bankruptcy filing is not yet on the horizon for Pier 1, which had about $71 million in cash as of December and $400 million available from a revolving credit line, one of the sources said. The company\u2019s debt begins coming due in 2021, and it is cutting spending.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based company in December said it hired Credit Suisse to advise on a \u201cfull range\u201d of strategic alternatives and that its chief executive had stepped down. The company acknowledged that a transformation plan it had dubbed \u201cA New Day,\u201d unveiled last year, failed to deliver results fast enough.  Pier 1\u2019s $200 million term loan coming due in 2021 is currently trading at about 50 cents on the dollar, according to data from financial services provider Refinitiv, indicating that investors are concerned about the company\u2019s prospects. Lenders holding the debt have organized and tapped their own advisers, the people familiar with the matter said, a move that often presages restructuring negotiations between a company and its creditors.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc in December said Pier 1\u2019s outlook was negative because of the chain\u2019s weak operating performance and uncertainty over whether it would be able to turn around its business. Pier 1\u2019s well-known brand may help it, though, the ratings agency said.  The downturn for retailers has led to high-profile bankruptcies including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. In the recent rout, furniture chains like Pier 1 have so far been insulated from the upheaval.

He is striding through the Kent town of Ramsgate towards the Royal Victoria Pavilion, a former assembly rooms built in 1903, with an ornate interior based on Marie Antoinette\u2019s Trianon theatre in Versailles. Martin has two things on his mind. One is what he spent to transform the 11,000 sq ft Royal Victoria into the most spectacular of the 883 public houses run by JD Wetherspoon, the pub chain that he founded four decades ago. The local authority handed over the dilapidated building free, but it cost \u00a34.5m to restore in 2017.  \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a bloody pub and it captured the imagination,\u201d he says. \u201cThe danger is that people come from far and wide to look, but business dies off when the novelty goes. It is a bit of a risk if it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d His second topic \u2014 Brexit \u2014 also involves a bit of risk. There are only weeks left before the UK is due to leave the EU, and British politics is in chaos, but Martin is unworried. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a sword of Damocles hanging over us,\u201d he says. Half an hour earlier, he had gestured to a local reporter at another Wetherspoons, like a trader promising a bargain: \u201cIf there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit, I\u2019ll bring the price of beer down!\u201d Martin has been impossible to ignore since the 2016 referendum \u2014 his 6ft 6in frame, long shock of grey hair and square jaw are constantly on television, railing for Brexit. The 63-year-old, who grew Wetherspoons from a single pub in London to the UK\u2019s third-largest managed pub chain, with a market capitalisation of \u00a31.3bn, has defied the business consensus that favours trade and economic continuity.  Tim Martin at The Peter Cushing pub in Whitstable. He makes a point of regularly visiting Wetherspoons pubs and seeking feedback from customers and employees By throwing his weight behind what he calls the \u201cmotley crew\u201d of Brexiters, he has given their political rebellion a stamp of entrepreneurial authority. His is a personal crusade \u2014 although he has spoken at Leave Means Leave events, he does not belong to a political party. As in business, he has trodden his own path, printing 500,000 beer mats advocating a no-deal Brexit, and replacing Belgian wheat ale with British across Wetherspoons branches.  The 17 million people who visited a \u201cSpoons\u201d in the past six months could read an in-house magazine lambasting the Remainer \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d, including the Financial Times. \u201cA \u2018deal\u2019 is just a trap laid by the CBI, the FT and others for keeping us in the EU,\u201d Martin wrote in the latest. The way in which Brexit and his business overlap is obvious as we enter the kitchen of the Royal Victoria, where a multinational team of workers is cooking energetically to meet Wetherspoons\u2019 benchmark of 10 minutes from order to meal being served. That, along with low prices (fish and chips with peas costs \u00a37.75 in Ramsgate), cleanliness (the pubs\u2019 average hygiene rating is 4.97 out of five) and decent quality ensure that the average Spoons sells 3,780 meals a week, including 800 breakfasts. The Royal Victoria\u2019s kitchen manager is Ildiko Kovacs, a 34-year-old Hungarian who has worked at three Wetherspoons pubs since moving to the UK as an EU citizen. The industry is heavily reliant on immigrants: of the 450,000 people working in British pubs and bars, 14 per cent are estimated to come from the EU, rising to 23 per cent in kitchens. At the Royal Victoria, there are 130 full-time and part-time workers, expanding to 200 in summer. Kovacs moved from a Spoons in Surrey for this job, buying a house in Margate with her partner. She is an enthusiast, talking of trying to surpass the company\u2019s food sales record set by The Velvet Coaster in Blackpool. \u201cOur record is \u00a397,000 [a week] and we\u2019re going to try to beat Blackpool this summer,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always in the high-volume mindset, getting it out as fast as possible\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u00a0can confidently say I love my job.\u201d \u201cWho can see into the future?\u201d Martin replies, laughing uneasily. It feels tactless from someone who advocates Brexit, albeit on the virtues of democracy and free trade. \u201cI\u2019m not against immigration,\u201d he had said as we walked through Ramsgate. \u201cIf someone has a job, I\u2019m not trying to stop them coming here. I\u2019ve said that when I\u2019ve gone around the country talking and I\u2019ve got a big cheer. There\u2019s a strong sense of grievance among Leavers that they\u2019re vilified for racism.\u201d The Peter Cushing is one of 883 Wetherspoons pubs across the UK. Martin's 32\u00a0per cent stake in the business is now worth \u00a3420m But it has also provoked a media backlash and unsettled his board. He says that the company\u2019s four non-executive directors differ with him on Brexit: \u201cI don\u2019t talk to them much about it because it\u2019s too emotional.\u201d David Page, an old friend and founder of the Franco Manca pizza chain, who voted Remain, says it is \u201cas personal to him as the pubs. I think he\u2019s sad about how divisive it has become but when Tim makes up his mind, it takes an earthquake to change it.\u201d Every Thursday morning, in an office block near Watford Junction station, north of London, a ritual occurs. It is the weekly management meeting at Wetherspoons\u2019 head office, known as the Wether Centre, where department and area heads gather, along with a sample of pub and kitchen managers and people from all levels, to pursue its distinctive approach to business, as recorded in its annual report: \u201cThe company aims to make lots of small improvements to its pubs.\u201d The god of small improvements was Sam Walton, late founder of Walmart, the US discount store chain, and Martin is his disciple. \u201cWalton\u2019s guys would go out on the road on Monday and they weren\u2019t allowed back in the office until Thursday afternoon,\u201d he recounts. \u201cThey would bring in ideas from customers and staff. The key is not to have the top brass reaching too many decisions.\u201d Martin, who lives in Exeter with his wife (they have four children) and spends one day a week in Watford, is travelling in when the February 7 meeting starts at 8.30am. John Hutson, Wetherspoons\u2019 chief executive since 2004 and a low-key counterfoil to Martin, sits on a stool at the front of the room, dressed in a black jersey, facing 80 managers seated in rows. Among the first items on the agenda is whether to drop Comic Sans, a quirky font that some, notably Tina Coppitters, Martin\u2019s friendly and loyal personal assistant, use on internal documents. There is a jokey debate on whether Comic Sans is Wetherspoons\u2019 official font and whether it matters. Hutson leans forward to catch a remark. \u201cMichelle says Comic Sans uses a bit more ink. We might save \u00a35 a year by changing,\u201d he reports. \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote,\u201d a wag calls from the back. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay as we are, even though it turns out we don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Hutson concludes. He turns to the next item, whether pizzas should be served with steak knives to cut them (the consensus is yes). Later, they debate whether to use latex-free kitchen gloves (yes); whether to add kombucha fermented tea to the drinks menu (perhaps); and where to put baby-changing facilities (women\u2019s toilets in new pubs). At 9.30am, Martin enters, dressed in his usual black Levi\u2019s jeans, striped Gant polo shirt and black Dr Martens shoes, as if he picked an outfit about the time he opened his first pub in 1979, and has seen no need to change. \u201cMorning, chaps,\u201d he says (the term \u201cchaps\u201d includes women \u2014 39 per cent of senior managers are female). \u201cMorning, Tim,\u201d the class mumbles. Martin relays some of his latest experiences visiting Wetherspoons\u2019 pubs and one of its 57 hotels, which the business began opening in 1998 to fill out its buildings. His gripes include \u201cone of the worst bin areas I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d at one pub, and there being only sparkling water in his room when he stayed at The Bull & Stirrup in Chester. \u201cThere were biscuits, which I thought was good, but who drinks fizzy water at night in a hotel?\u201d he asks. \u201cSomeone who hasn\u2019t had the Merlot,\u201d Hutson\u00a0interjects. The other foundation of its growth is scale and efficiency, passed on to the customer in low prices. \u201cWetherspoons is a thoroughbred with blinkers \u2014 it serves the same as others at a 30 per cent discount,\u201d says David Page. A pint at a Spoons is reliably cheap, leading to the urban myth that it buys discounted beer from suppliers just before the sell-by date. The truth is prosaic: like Walmart, its margins are low and its volumes very high. The company has roiled the industry since floating in 1992 at a value of \u00a346m. \u201cTim has stayed exceptionally grounded in what customers are saying and thinking,\u201d says Richard Pennycook, finance director in the mid-1990s. \u201cHe also had the skill to make it scale, which is rare, and the patience and tenacity to stick at it for year after year. From early on, he wanted to have 1,000 pubs.\u201d Customers at another \u2018Spoon\u2019 \u2013 The Rockingham Arms in south London. Wetherspoons pubs are bucking the national trend: overall, the number of pubs in Britain has fallen from 69,000 in 1980, while the volume of beer drunk in them has almost halved It is not the biggest pub chain \u2014 Greene King and Mitchells & Butlers directly manage more of the UK\u2019s 39,000 pubs, while companies such as Ei Group (formerly Enterprise Inns) lease thousands to \u201ctied\u201d landlords. But it frightens local bars the most when a Wetherspoons opens nearby. They are vulnerable after decades of pub closures, squeezed by everything from taxation to changing family habits. Last year brought a measure of relief \u2014 beer sales in pubs stabilised after falling for all but one of the past 18 years, partly thanks to warm summer weather and fans watching England World Cup games at pubs, according to the British Beer and Pubs Association. \u201cThe pub is the last social hub in some rural areas, with banks and post offices closing. People really care about them,\u201d says Brigid Simmonds, BBPA chief executive. But in a flat industry, the growth of Wetherspoons is at the expense of others. Martin did not just invent a more efficient pub, he expanded what a pub could be. In 1946, the writer George Orwell listed its ideal qualities as \u201cdraught stout, open fires, cheap meals, a garden, motherly barmaids and no radio\u201d. Martin banned music in his pubs, as well as naming some The Moon Under Water, after Orwell\u2019s mythical ideal pub. But his ambition for food was greater than Orwell\u2019s \u201ccut off the joint, two vegetables and boiled jam roll, for about three shillings\u201d. Wetherspoons started selling coffee from cappuccino machines, which now comes with free refills, in 2000 and opened for breakfast six days a week in 2002; food has grown from 18 per cent of sales in 2000 to 35 per cent last year. The change is evident as we walk into The Sir Norman Wisdom in Deal to find the rear area full of dining tables. The staff are enthusiastic but Martin is uneasy \u2014 he still wants what is known in the trade as a \u201cwet-led\u201d hostelry, where the prime activity is drinking. Rather than quantity, the business has shifted toward size and profitability \u2014 the average new opening last year was 5,200 sq ft compared with 3,640 in 2013. The archetypal Spoons has, as Orwell put it, \u201cregulars who occupy the same chair every evening and go there for conversation as much as for the beer\u201d, but they are propping up a far bigger bar than the local of Orwell\u2019s imagination. The Moon Under Water has grown into the Royal Victoria Pavilion.  As on other topics, he has his views on the National Health Service that eventually saved him (\u201cMy criticism of the NHS is that it\u2019s too much the sacred cow. It doesn\u2019t get the scrutiny it should\u201d). He was later told by a Wetherspoons pub manager in Exeter that, unlike him, she had been treated privately for appendicitis under the company\u2019s medical insurance. \u201cI was pleased about that,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought it was good, really.\u201d An egalitarian story is useful at the moment. Martin evangelises about treating his 40,000 staff well \u2014 \u201cPeople aren\u2019t paid a hundred grand a year in this industry, so if it\u2019s not an attractive environment, they go elsewhere.\u201d But staff from two pubs in Brighton went on strike over wages last October. \u201cI work in a great team and that is rewarding,\u201d says Chris Heppell, one of the strikers. \u201cBut Wetherspoons makes millions from our hard work and we\u2019re trapped between low pay and the rising cost of living.\u201d Martin still smarts from becoming lost for words in a video interview with the leftwing campaigner and Guardian columnist Owen Jones, who accused him of paying \u201cpoverty wages\u201d. He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost my cool in all these years, so he\u2019s got a bit of talent.\u201d  Wetherspoons is not the meanest pub employer: its over-25s starting rate of \u00a38.26 per hour is 5.5 per cent higher than the \u00a37.83 legal minimum wage (though lower than the voluntary \u201cliving wage\u201d of \u00a39 an hour) and it pays 15.8\u00a0per cent higher on average. It also gave \u00a343m in bonuses and free shares last year, 82 per cent of which went to pub employees. We are lunching in the Royal Pavilion at a high table with a sea view \u2014 fish and chips for me and jacket potato with tuna mayonnaise (\u00a36.75) for him, delivered in less than 10 minutes. Martin talks about his father, a Royal Air Force pilot who left at 29 with vertigo, and took a sales job with Guinness. Martin was born in Norwich and grew up in both Northern Ireland and New Zealand as his father\u2019s job moved. \u201cHe used to call me insubordinate. His idea of anathema was someone who argued all the time,\u201d Martin says. Yet this iconoclasm was crucial to Martin\u2019s success. Having studied law at Nottingham university and moved to London to study as a barrister, he found it hard: \u201cI thought, \u2018I can\u2019t spend my life reading at half the pace of everyone else.\u2019\u201d But he also studied at another bar \u2014 an independent pub in Muswell Hill, London, that was not tied to a brewer and served Ruddles County bitter. He ended up buying it for \u00a340,000 (partly financed by selling his flat) plus a holiday for the seller in Jamaica, where Martin\u2019s father was then working. Wetherspoons, named after a teacher at one of his schools, was independent from the start: he avoided buying pubs with ties to brewers, often converting other properties instead. Its pubs can be found in former cinemas, post offices and banks. The English Romantic painter JMW Turner called the skies over east Kent \u201cthe loveliest in all of Europe\u201d. He is commemorated in the Turner Contemporary gallery in the Victorian seaside resort of Margate, where Martin\u2019s driver drops us a mile short of The Mechanical Elephant pub. The late afternoon sun is indeed lovely, falling across the Dreamland amusement park and Margate bay. Martin has always been a walker \u2014 the first time we met, in the Knights Templar, a Spoons converted from a former bank in Chancery Lane, he was a few minutes late because he had walked across London from Paddington. As we emerged from the first pub on our tour of Kent, the Eight Bells in Dover, he cited a Thomas Hardy poem about the poet treading the same ancient path as when a child: \u201cThe Roman Road runs straight and bare/ As the pale parting-line in hair.\u201d By Margate, he has visited four pubs that day, and has three more to go. But he is on alert as we reach The Mechanical Elephant, named after a contraption driven by an engine that \u201cwalked\u201d the front with holidaymakers on its howdah in the 1950s. We stop to check the state of its flower baskets and three posters that are supposed to be on display. \u201cHow f-ing difficult is it to get right?\u201d he mutters. The Mechanical Elephant is on the endangered species list \u2014 it has been trading in a lacklustre fashion and a new manager has been brought in to make improvements. But as Martin enters the pub, filled with locals having a Friday afternoon pint of beer, his mood elevates. \u201cI\u2019m wearing high heels today,\u201d Martin replies, easing happily into bar room banter. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they\u2019re popular in Margate.\u201d \u201cWe might drive each other mad,\u201d Martin says. He introduces himself to the bar staff, getting one name wrong, then correcting it carefully in his notebook. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting hard of hearing,\u201d he apologises. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising \u2014 it\u2019s all that Captain Beefheart in the 1970s.\u201d Having ordered a cup of tea, he is soon perched by a high table at the rear, talking to the Elephant\u2019s new manager about his revival efforts. I chat to a group of middle-aged men gathered with pints at a table. One is Bernie Stone, a 64-year-old retired bricklayer who is a forthright Brexiter. \u201cI think England is an island on its own and it should work on its own. We don\u2019t have to be in the EU and pay them money left, right and centre,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have exports that go to Canada, America, China etc. We used to be a strong country. We are still a strong country.\u201d As I go, Martin is mulling over refurbishments with the manager, warming to the idea of reviving the Elephant. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving the bar upstairs and generally sprucing it up, I think,\u201d he says. Some other entrepreneurs who supported Brexit have invited charges of hypocrisy by planning to relocate themselves or their companies abroad. Sir James Dyson, founder of the consumer electronics company, is shifting his headquarters from the UK to Singapore. Sir James Ratcliffe, founder of the chemical group Ineos, has been reported to be considering moving to Monaco himself to avoid tax.  Martin is not leaving. The UK government received \u00a3729m in taxes from Wetherspoons\u2019 business in 2018, including VAT, national insurance and alcohol duty, but relocating the pubs is impossible and it is difficult to imagine him happy anywhere else but in one of them. He took a sabbatical in 2003 but returned as chairman after only six months. Nearing The Elephant, I had asked whether, at his age and with his fortune, he thought of retiring. \u201cThere\u2019s not actually much else I can do,\u201d he replied, mulling over the question as we walked. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad back, so I can\u2019t do many sports. If I work eight hours a day, I can still go for a walk for an hour or two, and have a couple of pints.

(Evan Vucci/AP) THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Over the vocal objections of the Trump administration, the Senate voted 54 to 46 yesterday to cut off U.S. support for the vicious, Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The invocation of the War Powers Act will soon be taken up in the House, where it has more than enough support to pass. Later today, the Senate is poised to pass the resolution of disapproval that rebukes President Trumps national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It has already advanced through the House. Seven Senate Republicans broke ranks on Yemen, and the White House now expects between 10 to 12 GOP senators will defect on todays wall vote, a senior administration official told my colleague Josh Dawsey last night. Coming from a Senate thats proved\u00a0so pliant to Trumps whims over the past two years, the back-to-back votes are significant and could foreshadow more resistance or independence to come. Trump has promised he will veto both bills. These would be his first vetoes since taking office. Though neither the House nor the Senate has the two-thirds necessary to override him on either one, the resolution of disapproval will provide fodder for lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the emergency declaration in courts. The one-two punch gets at the very heart of the separation of powers. Declaring war and spending money are bedrock powers assigned to Congress in the Constitution, but the legislative branch has abdicated both over time to what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called the imperial presidency. Trump knows hes going to lose on the floor today, aides say, but hes trying to wrangle enough votes so that hes not embarrassed by a lopsided final count. To lock down the support of Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for example, the administration promised that money for the wall wont be diverted from Arizona military construction projects. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) confer on Wednesday after the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) -- Senate Republicans tried to give Trump an off-ramp to defuse what could be described as a constitutional crisis, but the president wouldnt take it. The president rejected a compromise plan put forward by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which would have allowed him to score a victory on the disapproval vote, because he did not want to foreclose the possibility of using emergency powers again in the future to advance policy objectives that Congress does not support. Indeed, if he gets away with this emergency, it seems like a pretty safe bet hell be emboldened to try it again as will future Democratic presidents. Were standing on a slippery slope. Trump called Lee to express his opposition as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol. Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues, Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. Many Senate Republicans had started to align behind Lees measure, which would amend the National Emergencies Act to say an emergency declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to keep it. The goal is to give Congress the authority to approve a national emergency declaration not to disapprove it, as is currently the case in law. If it had become law, Lees bill could have affected Trumps national border emergency in the future, since ongoing national emergency declarations must be reaffirmed annually. And it would have affected future national emergencies declared by Trump, as well as by other presidents. Lee also sponsored the Yemen resolution with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagans solicitor general, and he clerked for Sam Alito when the future justice sat on the Third Circuit. The 47-year-old defeated an incumbent GOP senator in 2010 by promising Utahans that hed stand up to presidents in both parties. Congress is supposed to be the first among the federal governments three co-equal branches, Lee said in a statement. For decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch. -- On the national emergency vote, weve got a running whip count on our website. Kate Rabinowitz has compiled what every Republican senator has said about Trumps declaration. There are five hard yes votes on the resolution disapproval: Lee, Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). Tillis and Collins are considered two of the most vulnerable incumbents up for reelection next year. Six senators have publicly expressed concerns about the declaration: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Pat Toomey (Pa.). -- Twenty defections would be needed to override the veto, as Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Pence can cast a tiebreaking vote. No one thinks that will happen. -- The failure to make a deal with conservatives who wanted to find a way out is another indication of Pences limited juice. He cant effectively speak for Trump when hes on the Hill, and hes not empowered to negotiate the way Joe Biden was, partly because hes been undercut so many times by POTUS. There was an effort, numerous efforts, to engage with the vice president and the president, said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). But the president is not persuaded. I dont know of any president that likes to give up power. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) talks with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) before the State of the Union last month. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) -- Trump has tried to reframe his power grab not as a constitutional question, but as a matter of national security. Republican Senators are overthinking [the] vote on National Emergency, he tweeted yesterday. It is very simply Border Security/No Crime Should not be thought of any other way. -- But a lot of principled conservatives and libertarians dont see it that way. Indeed, todays vote will become a legacy-defining litmus test for many senators who fancy themselves as constitutionalists. Through the legal fiction of an emergency, the old rules that governed America, and ensured some democratic check on executive power, are sidelined, writes National Reviews Michael Brendan Dougherty. I happen to think Congress should fund more-extensive border security, including fencing. But conservatives have to defend the constitutional order that gives government acts the savor of legitimacy. That means Congress must reassert itself. Only scrupulous adherence to constitutional processes will keep the law supreme in America, Fein added. -- James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, doesnt get to vote in the Senate today. But he argued poignantly, and timelessly, in Federalist 58 that Congress having the power of the purse is one of the peoples most important checks on tyranny: This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. -- Beto ORourke is officially running for president. The former congressman and failed Senate candidate, who is in Iowa for the next few days, confirmed to the El Paso TV station KTSM\u00a0that he's joining the crowded field. I'm really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents, he texted the station last night. Its a big part of why Im running. -- In his campaign announcement video, O'Rourke struck the same upbeat tone he used when he campaigned against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last year.\u00a0Jenna Johnson reports: ORourkes announcement came after months of public reflection that included a solo road trip through rural America, a heart-to-heart talk with Oprah Winfrey and rallying with supporters near the southern border. ... 'The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate, have never been greater, and they will either consume us or they will afford us the greatest opportunity to unleash the genius of the United States of America, he said.

ORourke\u00a0told writer Joe Hagan that he was just born to do this:\u00a0Skeptics question whether ORourkes political transcendentalism can sustain the meat grinder of a national election. In a Democratic primary, he will not have the bogeyman of a Trump or a Ted Cruz from which to draw voter energy. He is decidedly not the street fighter many Democrats crave. And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Cruz in last years Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss. ... ORourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color. ...\u00a0The government at all levels is overly represented by white men, he says. Thats part of the problem, and Im a white man. So if I were to run, I think its just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. ...\u00a0I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country. And I think thats a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision. Especially in the fact that there are some really great candidates out there right now.

As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. ...\u00a0The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash. Both aircraft crashed just minutes after takeoff. Just 12 minutes into its journey to Pangkal Pinang, the Lion Air flight crashed into the sea off the coast of Java. The Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed roughly six minutes after leaving Addis Ababa.\u00a0 Both flights\u00a0struggled to gain altitude. The Lion Air flight failed to gain a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet, limiting the crew's room to gain control before the plane plummeted. Though the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is pending, preliminary data shows that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed.\u00a0 Both planes\u00a0appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing. The Lion Air plane pitched downward more than 24 times before its final plunge, all within its 12-minute journey. Though it is not yet clear what happened in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane also appeared to ascend and descend while accelerating. -- Trump privately disparaged the Boeing 737, which he said\u00a0sucked, before he ordered the grounding.\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa\u00a0and Josh Dawsey report: The president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757 ... which he owns as a personal jet. ... He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt.\u00a0...\u00a0Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was 'psychologically'\u00a0important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. ...\u00a0The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the countrys second-largest federal contractor.\u00a0 Trump should not have been the person making this decision, aviation experts said:\u00a0Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. 'Its not the presidents decision and it should never be the presidents decision,' he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols. -- Trump wanted his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to become the FAA administrator, a position thats remained vacant since Barack Obamas appointee finished his term in January 2018. The absence of an FAA leader has been noticeable amid the Boeing fallout. Following an inquiry from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether Trump is still considering Dunkin for the job, or whether he plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. (Isaac Stanley-Becker) -- Wednesday's order grounds more than 70 U.S. aircraft. The Max 8 planes\u00a0are used by American and Southwest airlines, which have a combined 58 of them in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the planes in its fleet. The software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a planes nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilots inputs. -- After the Ethio\u00adpian crash on Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, something it might have done sooner if not for the government shutdown.\u00a0The company and the FAA had been working to hash out the update but it was delayed because of the longest shutdown in U.S. history and differences of opinion, per the\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor: U.S. aviation regulators are expected to mandate the change by the end of April. Matthew Whitaker \"did not deny\" talking to Trump about Cohen, according to a House Democrat. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) -- During a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker did not deny that he and Trump personally discussed the government's case against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, according to\u00a0Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Karoun Demirjian reports: Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District, Nadler said following his meeting with Whitaker on Wednesday, referring to the U.S. attorneys office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Cohen.  According to Nadler, Whitaker did not deny that he had been 'directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.' He also did not deny that he had been 'involved in conversations about the scope' of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Bermans recusal from the Cohen case, Nadler said, and whether subordinate prosecutors at the Southern District of New York 'went too far' pursuing the campaign finance case in which Cohen has implicated Trump. The committees ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), who was present for Wednesdays interview with Whitaker, called Nadlers summary an 'interpretation'\u00a0and 'overreach,' while a Republican staff lawyer also present for the meeting said Whitaker simply could not remember ever conversing with Trump about Cohens case.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesdays meeting was not transcribed, complicating the matter of resolving Nadlers and Collinss diverging interpretations of Whitakers account. But Whitakers non-denials are raising questions among Trumps critics about whether his public testimony was accurate.\u00a0 -- Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of nearly eight years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow: In federal court Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Manafort and his attorneys for repeatedly casting his hard fall from power as collateral damage from the special counsels investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. For Manaforts crimes of illegally lobbying in Ukraine and hiding the proceeds overseas, then encouraging witnesses to lie on his behalf, Jacksons terms added 43 months to the 47 months he received in Alexandria federal court last week for bank and tax fraud. Her total sentence was 73 months in the D.C. case, but Jackson said 30 of those would overlap with the tally in Virginia. Asked if he would pardon Manafort, Trump said, I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. Its not something thats right now on my mind. -- Just minutes after Jackson handed down the sentence, a New York grand jury indicted Manafort on charges of residential mortgage fraud charges that fall outside Trumps pardon power. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: Under the Constitution, presidents have wide authority to pardon, but that power applies only to federal convictions, not state cases. New York State Attorney General Letitia James has urged the legislature to fix what Democrats call a double-jeopardy loophole in state law that could negate New Yorks ability to prosecute anyone pardoned by the president. New York lawmakers were working this week to undo the pardon loophole. The state charges could be challenged in the courts as a violation of double jeopardy protections for defendants, an area in which current New York law may favor Manafort. All told, Manafort will probably wind up serving about 6.5 years. He gets credit for the nine months he's already spent in jail. (Tom Jackman) Adding it up, Trumps allies and advisers have so far racked up more than two-and-a-half-presidential terms in prison time. (Philip Bump) -- A top prosecutor on Bob Muellers team is stepping down from the Justice Department, the latest and maybe biggest clue that the special counsel's investigation might soon wrap up. NPRs Carrie Johnson reports: Andrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts.\u00a0 -- Introducing a new character in this saga: Robert Costello, a\u00a0New York lawyer with connections to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that he could sleep well tonight because he had friends in high places \u00a0though he did not specifically mention a possible pardon from the president,\u00a0CNNs Gloria Borger and Jeremy Herb report: Cohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is utter nonsense. Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani. -- Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) rejected calls from House Republicans for an investigation into whether Cohen lied to Congress during his testimony two weeks ago. The Oversight chairman, however, left open the possibility of further action against Trumps former lawyer if new evidence of perjury is uncovered.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been tapping into a privately maintained database of license plates. (Marlon Correa/The Washington Post) -- Immigration agents have been tapping into a vast and privately maintained database of license plate numbers gathered from vehicles across the nation to track immigrants who may be in the United States\u00a0illegally. Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report: The records the ACLU obtained from the Department of Homeland Security through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on a little-noticed and expanding network of surveillance that has developed over the years and for which there appear to be few legal limitations. Immigration and Customs Enforcements use of some of the information in states including California also appears to skirt limitations that sanctuary cities have placed on police cooperation with the immigration agency, the ACLU said. ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said that agents use the license-plate database as a tool to help in its immigration-enforcement investigations and that it does not use the information to track people who have no connection to ICE investigatory or enforcement activities. -- For its upcoming mission to the moon, NASA is considering using commercial alternatives instead of the long-delayed rocket its been working on for years.

(Christian Davenport) -- The National Institutes of Health and other top scientists from seven nations are calling for a moratorium on gene-edited babies, sounding an alarm on the genetic engineering technique known as CRISPR. The call came in direct response to actions of a Chinese researcher who altered embryos that were implanted and carried to term.

(Seung Min Kim) Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks in Parliament ahead of the latest\u00a0Brexit vote. (Jessica Taylor/Reuters)\u00a0 -- The British Parliament rejected a no-deal departure twice, signaling that lawmakers are\u00a0likely to ask the other 27 members of the European Union\u00a0for permission to delay Brexit. William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report: The no-deal votes were in many ways symbolic taking the temperature of Parliament, rather than setting concrete policy. [Prime Minister Theresa] May said her government could ask the E.U. for a short extension to implement a deal if it passed by next week. If no deal is passed, May said she would be forced to seek a much longer delay. A longer delay would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections in May. -- The Pentagon is preparing to test missiles that have been banned by the INF Treaty. Paul Sonne reports: The U.S. military plans to test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of about 600 miles in August and a midrange ballistic missile with a range of about 1,800 to 2,500 miles in November The testing, production and deployment of missiles with those ranges is prohibited by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. But Trump withdrew from the treaty on Feb. 1 and triggered a formal six-month wait period before the final expiry of the agreement this summer. Washington has said Moscow is already deploying a missile that violates the agreement and cited that weapon as a reason for its withdrawal from the pact. The Kremlin has denied that accusation.\u00a0 -- The United States\u00a0and the Taliban have drafted an agreement on the withdrawal of American troops and the Talibans pledge to cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. NBC Newss\u00a0Dan De Luce reports: The talks between the Taliban insurgents and U.S. diplomats have lasted longer than any previous American attempt at negotiation with the militants since American troops entered Afghanistan in 2001. But it's unclear if the Afghan government and other Afghan political leaders will be ready to embrace the tentative deal worked out by [U.S. presidential envoy] Zalmay Khalilzad. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has expressed concerns that the Kabul government could be left out in the cold unless the Taliban agrees to meet face-to-face with his government.\u00a0 -- Power has been restored to Venezuela following nearly a week of darkness, according to the countrys information minister. At its worst, the power outage left 19 out of 23 states without energy. (CNN) -- The outage left the countrys second-largest city, Maracaibo, devastated as looters broke into hundreds of businesses. The APs Sheyla Urdaneta reports. -- Ten of Saudi Arabias most prominent womens rights activists appeared in court in Riyadh for the start of a trial that could signal whether the government will roll back an aggressive crackdown on political activists. Kareem Fahim reports: Many of the women have been tortured while in custody, according to relatives and human rights groups. Saudi officials deny those allegations. ALQST, a Saudi rights group based in London, said Wednesday that the women are being charged under the countrys Cyber Crime law with offenses related to their activism, including contacting human rights groups. The charges carry sentences of up to five years in prison.\u00a0 -- This sham trial exposes Saudi Arabias disrespect for its citizens, writes Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi activist and scholar and The Washington Posts first Jamal Khashoggi fellow: The women have been subjected to horrific torture and sexual harassment, but in a statement the government claimed the accused were enjoying their full rights. Meanwhile, state-linked social media accounts have already virtually convicted the activists and are asking for the maximum punishment. ... Against this background, Saudi Arabia decided to appoint its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar. Its another opportunity to push an apologetic reform narrative amid U.S. congressional scrutiny and pressure. Many will take the bait, as they did when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first came to power. In our collective conscience as a nation, these female activists facing trial and the men who support them were instrumental in influencing reforms.\u00a0 -- Gary Cohn, Trumps former economic adviser, said the president is desperate for a trade deal with China.\u00a0David J. Lynch reports: The president needs a win, Cohn said in an interview with Freakonomics, a public radio show and podcast.\u00a0\u00a0Cohn said he supported the presidents desire to crack down on unfair Chinese trade practices, but he said tariffs dont work. As evidence, he pointed to last years\u00a0record $891 billion trade deficit in merchandise\u00a0and the record $419 billion gap in trade with China. So tariffs were used as the threat. Did it hurt the Chinese at all? We had record trade deficits, Cohn said. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz often talks about growing up in a public housing project.\u00a0(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) In 1956, the New York City Housing Authority opened Bayview as a moderate income development, built a block away from Jamaica Bay Superficially, Bayview looked much like any city housing development, a collection of brick towers with balky stainless-steel elevators and hallways of green linoleum floors and glazed, aqua-tiled walls. But Bayview, which Schultzs family moved into in its opening year, was built as a no cash subsidy project, according to city records. That meant that unlike developments subsidized by the federal or state government, Bayview had minimum income requirements for tenants, charged higher rents intended to cover the entire cost of its mortgage, and was built to high standards compared to [federal] projects, according to Affordable Housing in New York, a history of public housing in the city.\u00a0 -- In a speech to Miami Dade College detailing how he would run the government, Schultz vowed that he would not sign bills that arent passed with bipartisan support and said he will nominate only Supreme Court justices who could be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate a naive statement for anyone who has been watching the judicial wars.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders, Schultz said. These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change. He said he would fill his cabinet with Democrats, Republicans and Independents, including a greater share of women than any previous president. He promised to work to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing legislative and congressional districts to preserve one partys power. That process is controlled by the states, not Washington, but Schultz said he would push for independent commissions to draw those districts in the future. -- Big Democratic donors are sending their money to four key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania. The\u00a0Wall Street Journals Julie Bykowicz reports: Two of the Democrats best-funded outside groups both of which are backed in part by New York billionaire George Soros are planning at least a $130 million campaign to attack President Trump and build support for Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, where Mr. Trump narrowly prevailed over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. A third group, an $80 million voter-engagement effort, is at work in these and three other battleground states. The latest Democratic spending commitment comes from opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century, which plans to put at least $30 million largely into the four states. Conservative lawyer George Conway, the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, called Trump a pathological liar after the president falsely insisted that the judge in Manaforts case cleared him of collusion. Its not rational, because its a lie that no reasonable person would believe, he tweeted. It undermines his credibility. Its self-defeating. Have we ever seen this degree of brazen, pathological mendacity in American public life? One day he makes a harmless slip of the tongue, something any mentally balanced person would laugh off. But one lie on any subject is never enough for Donald Trump. So he next tells a different lie. Yes, I omitted a word, but to save time. A ridiculous assertion, of coursehe really said Tim Apple instead of Tim Cook of Apple to save **a third of a second**? ridiculous because it was irrelevant to the charges at handnot that there was no proof of collusion, just that whether there was or wasnt was irrelevant to the proceedings at hand. And yet he lies againa blatant lieabout what the judge said in open court. Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this mans condition of mind. To be clear, GOP wins elections when theyre about ideas not when theyre personality contests like Dems & media want. Were clearly better off because of @RealDonaldTrump. His record of accomplishment is why hell win re-election especially when compared to Dems leftward lurch.

(AP) Tucked away off Route 140 in the small town of Hopedale, Green Mountain Chocolate Co. churns out millions of truffles, holiday candy and chocolate-covered potato chips each year. Owned by husband-and-wife team Bill and Lisa Campbell, the company has grown to become one of the leading chocolate manufacturers in Massachusetts. The couple bought the company in 2002 from Albert Kumin a legendary pastry chef who created desserts for Jimmy Carter's White House and moved the business from Vermont to Franklin, Massachusetts. Today, the company operates two retail stores one in Franklin and one adjacent to its Hopedale factory. \"We're a wholesale manufacturer for the industry, first and foremost,\" Bill Campbell said. \"Opening a retail store was kind of secondary to us, and now both retail stores are incredible. They keep growing every year. We have great customers, we have great employees.\" Seventeen years ago, the Campbells decided they were ready for a change. Lisa had just earned her teaching license and Bill was working as the director of national accounting for a chocolate company when Kumin, a longtime friend, told Bill he wanted to get rid of his business. \"I said, 'Sell it to me,'\" Bill Campbell said. \"We just figured it was a good opportunity, we really looked into the business. It was established, we thought it was a fair price and we thought it had room for growth.\" Today, they manufacture everything from truffles which the company is best known for to chocolate Easter bunnies and fudge. \"When people come into our store, it's not like going into CVS. They're coming in because they want a gift, they want to give something or get something that's going to enrich their lives as a sweet or happy moment,\" he said. \"That's a fun part of the business we are a happy place to come and we try to be fun here. We're always laughing.\" But Bill Campbell said running the sweet business has not been without its challenges. Campbell said he's had to learn a lot over the years everything from how to fix broken machinery to the importance of closely monitoring the sugar, milk and cocoa markets. He's also seen the industry evolve over the years. \"She's really great at it. We always laugh that she's like a bartender,\" Bill Campbell said. \"She loves her customers. Her customers will come in and talk to her they trust her, whether it be about chocolate, what they're buying, or kids and family.\" Although Lisa never ended up teaching professionally, Bill said she teaches her employees every day. \"We always hire high school girls or boys to work in the store, and she's demanding, but she's such a great teacher and an inspiration for them,\" he said. Bill said that being good, a fair employer is important to his family. The company's employees, which range seasonally from 10 to 12 in the summer to 25 to 35 during the busier seasons, are offered 401(k) plans, health insurance and other benefits.

Offer them a different thing, and they're likely to re-evaluate whether they want to be there at all.\" After all, Friendster and Myspace came and went as Facebook grew. Yahoo and AltaVista moved over for Google. And remember when AOL was popular, powerful and rich enough to buy the traditional media company Time Warner? Both AOL and Yahoo are now fading brands within Verizon. This involves scrambling all messages in WhatsApp, Instagram Direct and Messenger so that even Facebook itself can't read them. Facebook will also let messages automatically disappear after a set amount of time, something rival Snapchat already does. Facebook, Zuckerberg said, will \"then build more ways for people to interact on top of that, including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services.\" Facebook declined to further elaborate on its ambitions, and a spokeswoman reinforced that it is early in the process. But there are clues in what Chinese tech giant Tencent has already done with WeChat in China. WeChat combines functions that are typically done by separate companies elsewhere think of Facebook and its messaging services combined with PayPal and Uber. People use WeChat to buy goods in retail stores, split restaurant bills with friends, pay utility bills, donate to charities and hail rides from the Uber-like Didi Chuxing service. Facebook already lets people send money to other individuals through Messenger in the U.S. and a few other countries and is testing payments through WhatsApp in India. The New York Times reported that Facebook is also developing its own digital currency to make it easier for users to send money to their messaging contacts. Facebook didn't offer many details on its digital currency endeavors, but said a \"new small team\" was looking for ways to make use of the type of technology powering bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. While the current payment options require linking Facebook to bank accounts or services such as PayPal, a digital currency could potentially work without them. That could appeal to users, especially in Asia and Africa, with limited access to banking services, said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in security and payments. And it would solve a key challenge with commerce on phones. Litan said entering credit card details on a phone is cumbersome, and businesses often lose customers before they complete orders. If Facebook can integrate payments into messaging, it can keep users within Facebook and convince advertisers they're more likely to complete sales. Facebook could also diversify revenue beyond advertising. For instance, it could take a commission, whether for newspaper subscriptions or food deliveries, much as Apple already does with a cut of up to 30 percent for app payments. Kay said messaging could become one-stop shop for Yelp-like business reviews, OpenTable restaurant reservations, on-demand delivery similar to Uber and a marketplace akin to eBay the latter being something Facebook already offers on its main app. Amazon might be tougher to challenge, he said, given the company's expertise in delivery logistics, but there might be pieces such as grocery delivery that Facebook can go after. Nonetheless, potential Facebook rivals need not pack up yet. Zuckerberg's blog read as a manifesto, a list of things he wants to implement, and it's unclear how much will actually get executed, eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. She said it's too soon for competitors to start drastically adapting. There also might be room for Facebook to sit alongside existing services. Facebook might turn to OpenTable within messaging, for instance, rather than build its own service for dinner reservations. \"It depends on what exactly the product looks like and how differently useful it is for different kinds of audiences,\" said Brian Wieser, an executive at the advertising consultancy GroupM. \"It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.\" For now, analysts say, potential competitors need to pay attention and be ready to adapt once details are out. Businesses that ignore the threat do so at their own peril. Potential rivals can also start emphasizing how they are different from Facebook as Apple is doing by stressing privacy protections in its devices and services. O'Donnell added that those in payments need to make sure their services are compelling and easy to use so that they can compete with whatever Facebook brings. The most immediate threat Facebook poses is to other messaging services. Apple's iMessage is popular on iPhones, but there's no version for Android. Facebook could look more appealing as it breaks down walls and makes its three discrete messaging services work together as though they were one. Snapchat, meanwhile, has struggled since Facebook and its Instagram service copied a feature for posting temporary \"stories\" that disappear after 24 hours. Zuckerberg dedicated a section of his blog announcement to \"reducing permanence,\" suggesting that Facebook will now take on Snapchat's core feature of letting photos \"disappear\" after a set number of seconds. \"It's yet another example of Facebook trying to attack Snapchat,\" BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said. Facebook's plan may face external competition of its own. Unlike WeChat, Facebook faces new privacy regulation in Europe and calls for more controls in the U.S., Forrester analyst Jessica Liu wrote . Zuckerberg is trying to strike an \"impossible balance\" between capturing more of users' time, appealing to advertisers and appealing to regulators. \"Zuckerberg can't have his cake and eat it, too,\" she wrote.", "tags": ["payments", "plan", "donald trump", "analyst", "analysts"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Facebook\u2019s messaging ambitions amount to much more than chat - Washington Post", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebooks-messaging-ambitions-amount-to-much-more-than-chat/2019/03/12/2374ff12-4503-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html"}, {"title": "Tencent vows to keep up spending spree", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0903adee-416c-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44"}, {"title": "Facebook exec's farewell letter highlights tension over Zuckerberg's privacy strategy, report says", "source": "fox-news", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/facebook-execs-farewell-letter-highlights-tension-over-zuckerbergs-privacy-strategy-report-says"}]}, {"title": "Facebook\u2019s messaging ambitions amount to much more than chat - Washington Post", "source": "the-washington-post", "date": "2019-03-12T20:12:55Z", "origContent": "The companys ambitions harken to how WeChat has become the centerpiece of digital life in China, where people use it to order movie tickets, subway passes, food delivery and rides.

Six quotes that came out on Monday, from a range of sources, could be grouped together and put into a time capsule to help future historians make sense of American politics circa 2019. -- The first is a little-noticed paragraph inside the 150-page budget request that President Trump submitted to Congress on Monday: Even with high levels of economic growth, excessive deficits continue to threaten the Nations progress, and any unforeseen shocks to the economy could make deficits unsustainable, it says. If financial obligations continue to grow at the current pace, the Nations creditors may demand higher interest rates to compensate, potentially leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock, harming both American businesses and workers. The document warns that deficits are on track to remain over a trillion dollars per year for the foreseeable future, the national debt now $22 trillion will soon surpass a percent of GDP not seen since 1947, and interest payments alone on the federal governments debt will double by 2023 and exceed spending on the U.S. military by 2024 if nothing is done. The White House projects that the government will need to spend $482 billion on interest payments for the debt next year alone. Thats more than the entire budget for Medicaid. Whats remarkable is that there is no evidence of meaningful political will to tackle this potentially existential crisis. Leaders in both parties called the budget dead on arrival. Although the budget proposes the most spending reductions ever sent to Congress, as one of Trumps top aides put it, the deficit is expected to hit $1.1 trillion this year and stay above the trillion mark every year through at least 2022, economics correspondent Heather Long reports. This is unprecedented in good economic times and is occurring because Trump and Congress are spending more at the same time the GOP tax cuts drive down government revenue. (Trumps budget shows small increases the next few years in tax revenue, but that might be a stretch given what is occurring so far this fiscal year). What should give Americans heartburn is that even the dire numbers are based on some fantastical if not impossible assumptions, including that there will not be a recession at any point in the next decade. No president likes to predict a downturn, but Trump is being exceptionally rosy in his outlook, Heather notes. His budget predicts about 3 percent growth every year for a decade. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of slightly below 2 percent a year. To achieve Trumps projection, the economy would have to grow at A-plus potential for years with no recessions, something the United States has never achieved before. There are certainly some fiscal hawks who work inside the administration, like acting OMB director Russ Vought and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but what matters is who sits in the Oval Office. Trump has called himself the king of debt and argued privately that deficits dont really matter because they wont blow up until after he leaves office. He didnt even mention the issue during his recent State of the Union address. Theres a pattern of Republican politicians demanding fiscal responsibility when theyre in the wilderness but then spending like drunken sailors on shore leave when they hold power. Its happening again. The 2017 GOP tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the richest 1 percent of Americans and the biggest corporations, will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. With no change in trajectory, the ship of state will continue drifting down a river that ends with a waterfall. Former vice president Dick Cheney attends a memorial ceremony for George H.W. Bush at the Capitol in December. (Jonathan Ernst/AP) 2. Dick Cheney: Were getting into a situation when our friends and allies around the world that we depend upon are going to lack confidence in us. I worry that the bottom line of that kind of an approach is we have an administration that looks a lot more like Barack Obama than Ronald Reagan. The former vice president uncorked one of the most searing conservative critiques to date of Trumps foreign policy while conducting a Q&A with Vice President Pence at a donor retreat this weekend sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. Someone leaked a transcript yesterday of the off-the-record session on Sea Island, Ga. Cheney respectfully but repeatedly and firmly pressed Pence on a number of the presidents foreign policy moves, Ashley Parker and Bob Costa report. He expressed concerns at such actions as taking a harder line toward U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deciding to withdraw troops from Syria during what he fretted was the middle of a phone call. Cheney expressed alarm over news reports that Trump supposedly doesnt spend that much time with the intel people, or doesnt agree with them, frequently, as well as the high staff turnover rate at the intelligence agencies. He worried aloud, again and again, that for Trump, foreign policy boils down to a crude dollars-and-cents transaction. He worried about Trumps decision to cancel the decades-long U.S. military exercises with South Korea and referenced a recent Bloomberg News report about the presidents directive to pursue a policy that would insist that the Germans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans pay total cost for our deployments there, plus 50 percent on top of that. I dont know, that sounded like a New York state real estate deal to me, Cheney quipped. Pence, unprepared for tough questions, mostly shrugged off Cheneys concerns and praised Trump as a transformational leader. Reading the transcript shows what a total loyalist Pence has become to Trump. He staked out several positions that are at odds with the posture he took as a congressman and governor. Moreover, the conversation between the two men who have held the No. 2 job underscored the deep fissures that remain inside the GOP over Trumps foreign policy. Its the same tension that led to Jim Mattiss resignation in December as defense secretary after Trump abruptly announced the complete withdrawal of troops from Syria. The president eventually relented under pressure from hawks on the Hill. Some troops will stay. 3. Nancy Pelosi: Im not for impeachment. Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless theres something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I dont think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And hes just not worth it. The California Democrat said this knowing that shed take instant and intense heat from her left flank, which she has, but her goal appears to be protecting vulnerable moderate members who are up for reelection next year in districts that Trump carried. Pelosi saw firsthand what happened to Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Shes realistic that the Republican-controlled Senate wouldnt convict Trump to remove him from office if Democrats acted unilaterally, and she gave herself an out to change her mind if something new emerges.\u00a0 Many Democratic strategists believe that impeachment would give Trump a useful foil and get recalcitrant Republicans to rally behind him for 2020, barring big new bombshells from the investigations by special counsel Bob Mueller or newly empowered congressional committees. Pelosi is one of the shrewdest tacticians in modern political history, and she appears to be playing a long game of trying to increase her partys odds of keeping its majority. While liberal firebrands have won an outsize share of media coverage, the House Democratic majority was captured largely because of freshmen who ran to the center, said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and many of them are uncomfortable with impeachment talk, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report. Weve got 31 Democrats who serve in districts that Donald Trump won, and Im one of them, Bustos said. When I go home, I dont have people asking me about impeaching him. That is just not something that I hear. They consistently ask about health care and rebuilding our country and figuring out how to work together. President Trump celebrates the passage of the GOP tax cuts in December 2017 with Paul Ryan. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) 4. Paul Ryan on 2020: The person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isnt going to win it. The former speaker of the House reportedly said during a speech last night in Vero Beach, Fla., that there are some Democrats who could beat Trump and the president must make the race about his policies, not his personal brand, if hes going to prevail. Ryan said one of the Houses biggest mistakes during his tenure was taking too long to negotiate a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Ali Schmitz reports for Treasure Coast Newspapers. Ryan blamed the right-leaning flank of the party, including the Freedom Caucus, for causing a three-month delay in moving the legislation through the House. That three-month delay eroded public support for it, so by the time it got over to the Senate, it was hanging on a thread, Ryan said. Ryan said if there werent delays in moving it through the House, he would have expected it to pass the Senate. The 2012 GOP nominee for vice president said technology has created an outrage machine, according to the story: He said people are monetizing emotions, causing entertainment wings of each party that focus on emotional responses rather than focusing on the merits of their policies. 5. Tucker Carlson: [W]e will never bow to the mob ever. No matter what. Ryan didnt mention Carlson, but theres no doubt that the former House speaker was talking about people like him when he lamented the entertainment wing of the GOP and the way it is monetizing emotions. Carlson also spoke crassly of immigrants and questioned Barack Obamas identity as a black man. How is he black, for one thing? He has one white parent, one black parent, he said in 2006. Two years later, he added, I dont know how black he is, but Im sure hes a good basketball player he says he is, anyway. Carlson went on the air about the same time the second video was released and said his critics werent motivated by genuine concern. He said theyre trying to silence him. Carlson praised the network for having his back even after the revelations. We live in an era of conservative counterpunchers. Tellingly, Donald Trump Jr. praised Carlson for refusing to apologize:  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 11, 2019 6. Donald Trump: The Democrats hate Jewish people. During her first news conference in more than 40 days, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly declined to answer yesterday whether Trump truly believes Democrats hate Jewish people. In this case, its the president saying that the opposition party hates an entire faith of people and his press secretary not even trying to walk it back. The fact that it barely moves the needle shows how normalized over-the-top rhetoric, and questioning peoples motives, has become in the Trump era. The numbers dont bear out Trumps claims. Thirty-two of the 34 Jewish members of Congress are Democrats. According to the Pew Research Center, more than 70 percent of Jewish Americans voted for [Hillary Clinton] in the 2016 presidential election, Eugene Scott notes. An October 2018 poll found that 74 percent of Jews planned to vote for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. Three quarters of respondents disapproved of the presidents policies. The president has developed close ties with Israel, and in particular [Bibi Netanyahu], but being pro-Israel and being the party of American Jews is not the same thing. -- Britain just banned the Boeing 737 Max from its airspace after China, Australia and other nations grounded the jets in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia. Gerry Shih reports:When China became the first country on Monday to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, its aviation regulator sent an unmistakable signal: the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is no longer the only authority in civil aviation worldwide. Chinas move, which was unprecedented for a government that once took cues from the FAA, was motivated by what Chinese officials and pilots said was months of equivocation from U.S. officials and Boeing in response to safety inquiries from China after the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last October.  After China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes roughly a quarter of all 737 Max in operation globally authorities in Ethiopia, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco and Mongolia quickly followed suit, as did carriers in Latin America and South Korea. Despite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jets airworthiness, Britain, Australia, Malaysia and Oman became the latest countries to ground the model a day later, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation. The U.S. embassy in Caracas.

Paul Schemm reports: The United States and the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are increasingly at odds, with the Trump administration openly supporting his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the countrys legitimate leader. The country has been crippled by a five-day power outage that has plunged people into darkness and left food and water scarce. The government announced that schools and commercial activities would again be suspended on Tuesday due to the power outage.Appearing on television Monday, Maduro stated that progress was being made in restoring power. He blamed the crisis on sabotage. -- A Venezuelan journalist whom Maduro allies have accused of orchestrating the blackout is missing, and press freedom\u00a0groups believe the government is holding him.\u00a0The reporter, Luis Carlos Diaz, has been a frequent critic of Maduro's government and frequently been the target of online attacks by accounts close to Maduro's government after he revealed\u00a0the state-run telephone and Internet provider in Venezuela was phishing its users.

(Cathy Free) -- Nancy Pelosi promised that the House will reject Trumps budget, and even many congressional Republicans criticized various elements of the proposal. Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report: And the demand for $8.6 billion for a border wall, less than two months after a 35-day shutdown paralyzed much of Washington, raised the possibility that there could be an even more dramatic impasse if a spending deal isnt reached by the end of September. Top White House officials acknowledged that lawmakers routinely dismiss these budget proposals, but they signaled a willingness on Monday to fight harder this year than they have in the past. Trumps GOP allies, meanwhile, received the budget plan with a lukewarm embrace. The defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps. -- Trumps proposal to cut Medicare spending by $845 billion over the next 10 years, despite his campaign promises to protect the popular program, will encounter some of the strongest resistance.\u00a0From Jeff Stein and Amy Goldstein: Most of the trims relate to changing payments to doctors and hospitals\u00a0 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Social Security, the retirement program for the elderly, but his budget last year also included a proposed cut of more than $550 billion to the program. -- Medicare-for-all v. Medicare-for-less: Trumps proposed cuts put health care at center of 2020 race,\u00a0Toluse Olorunnipa and Sean Sullivan report: Trumps proposed Medicare savings are more than three times as large as those in his previous budget, and industry lobbying groups said the reductions would hurt hospitals and seniors. ... Democratic strategists and officials argued Monday that Trumps budget proposal exposed how little credibility Republicans have in debating health care, and showed signs of confidence that it would sharpen the contrast Democrats are seeking to make in the run-up to the 2020 election. -- Cronyism alert: One of the budget's clearest beneficiaries is Trump's golfing buddy\u00a0Jack Nicklaus, the namesake of a children's hospital in Miami. Under the proposal, the Health and Human Services Department would steer $20 million toward a mobile children's hospital project at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Politico's Dan Diamond reports: Nicklaus had lobbied Trump on the golf course in Florida, and he met with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in Washington, D.C., to request funds, say two individuals with knowledge. Trump personally directed HHS to earmark the funds to help Nicklaus develop mobile children's hospitals, one individual said.\u00a0 -- Trumps budget proposal would hit Americas poor the hardest,\u00a0slashing billions of dollars in food stamps, health insurance and federal housing subsidies while pushing legislation to institute broad work requirements for families receiving housing vouchers, expanding on moves by some states to require recipients of Medicaid and food stamps to work,\u00a0Caitlin Dewey, Tracy Jan and Jeff Stein report. It would gut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, by $17.2 billion and would redesign the entire program, using a portion of SNAP benefit money to buy and deliver a monthly food box. Eaters Whitney Filloon writes the proposal claims the box would significantly reduc[e] the cost to taxpayers, but provides no information on how shipping a box of government-selected canned goods to millions of people would be at all cost-saving. It would slash the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget by 14 percent,\u00a0eliminating the entire fund for public housing capital repairs. Trump called for cutting a federal housing subsidy program that experts estimate would result in more than a quarter-million low-income families losing\u00a0assistance. -- The budget would slash $8.5 billion from the Department of Education. Moriah Balingit and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel report: Trumps budget request again seeks to cut popular programs, including one that supports after-school activities for children in impoverished communities and another that offers wide-ranging grants that underwrite textbooks, equipment, counseling services and other needs for schools. That pool of money the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program also underwrites school safety efforts, including mental-health services and school safety equipment. -- The budget would also make federal workers pay more toward their retirement benefits until the employee and government share is equal. Eric Yoder reports: For most employees that would mean an increase of about six percentage points, which would be phased in as one percentage point more per year. The government share would decrease on the same schedule. Also under the proposal, for employees retiring after an unspecified date, annuity benefits would be based on the highest five consecutive salary years rather than the currently used 'high-3.'\u00a0Further, it would end a supplemental benefit paid to many employees who retire before age 62, when they become eligible for Social Security.\u00a0 -- House Dems are likely to skip a vote on a budget this year to avoid what could be an embarrassing intraparty battle. Though publicly many Democrats have said they want a chance to vote on their partys fiscal blueprint, privately theyre saying that a budget is unlikely to come to a vote given the multiple divisions within the caucus.

(Alex Brandon/AP) -- New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four Trump Organization projects, as well as Trump's failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills. Michael Cohen testified during last month's hearing that Trump inflated his assets in financial statements, and Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank. The inquiry by Ms. Jamess office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear,\u00a0the Timess William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim report. -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)\u00a0is seeking\u00a0testimony from\u00a0two lawyers responsible for Trumps ethical and financial disclosures. But the White House is blocking him from talking to a potentially key witness. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown report: White House Counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of making 'grossly unfair' allegations against Stefan Passantino and Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon both of whom Cummings wants to interview and damaging their reputations. Last month, Cummings sent a letter to Cipollone that stated the committee has obtained new documents showing Passantino and Dillon 'may have provided false information' when they were questioned by federal ethics officials about hush money payments paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. ...\u00a0In response, Cipollone chided Cummings for directly requesting an interview with Passantino, instead of going through the White House counsel's office, and said the White House would not make Passantino available. -- Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will return to Capitol Hill tomorrow for a private meeting with the House Judiciary Committee. Karoun Demirjian reports: In a letter to Whitaker after his testimony, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said members of the panel found Whitakers answers unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence, stressing that they wanted to meet with him again so he could elaborate on his testimony. Nadler questioned Whitakers testimony indicating that he never discussed Trumps frustration with Michael Cohen. -- The Senate Intelligence Committee spoke privately to Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, who is married to former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Karoun Demirjian reports: The panel asked Mangiante Papadopoulos about her former employer Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor with suspected ties to the Kremlin ... Mifsud, prosecutors have said, offered to help her husband ... broker meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials Mangiante Papadopoulos said congressional investigators were more focused on her experience working with Mifsud than what she knew of her husbands activities during the campaign. -- Attorneys for Roger Stone apologized in a new filing last night for misrepresenting to a federal judge plans about his new book criticizing Bob Mueller. But they said it was an unintentional mistake\u00a0and the court can still seat an impartial jury.\u00a0Spencer S. Hsu reports: Attorneys for the Republican operative and longtime friend of President Trump acknowledge that the gaffe could land Stone in jail if the judge finds he violated a gag order in his case barring him from feeding prejudicial pretrial publicity. But they denied using an erroneous March 1 filing notifying the court of the 'imminent release' of the book after the judge imposed the gag order Feb. 21 to build publicity for the work, 'The Myth of Russian Collusion,' a retitled version of his earlier book about Trumps 2016 campaign, with a new introduction. 'There was/is no intention to hide anything,'\u00a0wrote Stones attorneys. -- The same federal judge overseeing Stones criminal case, Amy Berman Jackson, will decide tomorrow whether to add prison time to Manaforts sentence. Spencer reports: The looming question Wednesday is whether any prison time Jackson might impose will overlap or be tacked on to the 47-month term Manafort received last week from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria. In overseeing the Manafort case and the separate case of [Stone], Jackson has given a master class in how to try high-profile cases, some colleagues on the bench said, by relying on preparation, discretion and a refusal to get drawn into side disputes. -- For what it's worth, the special counsel's effort is fully funded through the end of September.

Customs and Border Protection announced that a task force drawn from six law enforcement organizations had seized 3,200 pounds of cocaine a street value of $77 million on Feb. 28, not from some dusty overland trail in Texas, but from a shipping container that arrived at the port in Newark. It was the largest cocaine seizure at the port in nearly 25 years. -- More than 2,000 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody have been quarantined amid an outbreak of mumps and other contagious diseases. From CNNs Geneva Sands, Michelle Lou and Susan Scutti: As of March 7, 2019, there was a total of 2,287 detainees cohorted for exposure to a detainee with a contagious condition, said ICE spokesperson Brendan Raedy in a statement. In the past 12 months, there have been health investigations at 51 ICE detention facilities for mumps, chickenpox and influenza, according to Raedy. There have been 236 reported cases of mumps, with another 16 suspected cases during this time period. It was unclear Monday, if ICE was taking additional steps to deal with issues of disease in its facilities. -- Top officials at a troubled Texas charity for migrants resigned following months of investigations into allegations of mismanagement and malfeasance.\u00a0The Times's Nicholas Kulish, Kim Barker and Rebecca R. Ruiz report: For months, Juan Sanchez was at the center of the national uproar over family separations at the Mexican border because the nonprofit he founded, Southwest Key Programs, was housing migrant children taken from their parents. On Monday, facing intense scrutiny from his own organization and federal investigations over alleged financial improprieties, he stepped down after 32 years at the helm. ...\u00a0The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Tex., known as Casa Padre, became a symbol of the Trump administrations family separation policy, with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children. But it was also a generator of millions of dollars in federal grants at a nonprofit unusually concerned with its bottom line. ...\u00a0Mr. Sanchez earned $1.5 million in 2017, the most recent tax return available. His wife earned $500,000. His daughter from a previous marriage also held a senior position, but her salary was not available. Ms. Chung earned $1 million.\u00a0 -- The Customs and Border Protection agency plans to implement a biometric entry-exit system\u00a0using\u00a0facial recognition technology on more than 100 million travelers flying out of the United States. BuzzFeed News's Davey Alba reports\u00a0on\u00a0documents obtained by the nonprofit research organization Electronic Privacy Information Center: These same documents state explicitly that there were no limits on how partnering airlines can use this facial recognition data. CBP did not answer specific questions about whether there are any guidelines for how other technology companies involved in processing the data can potentially also use it. ... CBP did not explain what its current policies around data sharing of biometric information with participating companies and third-party firms are, but it did say thatthe agency 'retains photos for up to 14 days' of non-US citizens departing the country, for 'evaluation of the technology' and 'assurance of the accuracy of the algorithms'\u00a0 which implies such photos might be used for further training of its facial matching AI.\u00a0 Facial recognition technology is already at use in 17 international airports, including\u00a0New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Houston. Major airlines including Delta, American Airlines and British Airways support the usage of this technology. -- The apparel manufacturing, taxi and limousine services, as well as\u00a0nail salons and personal care industries depend the most on immigrant labor, according to a new report by the New American Economy group.

William Booth and Karla Adam report: On Tuesday, British lawmakers are scheduled to vote again on [Prime Minister Theresa]\u00a0Mays withdrawal agreement, along with the supplemental statements. A possible series of votes this week will help determine whether Britain will depart on schedule on March 29 or whether there will be more uncertainty, division and delay. -- Pelosi and Mitch McConnell extended a rare bipartisan invitation to NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to address a joint session of Congress next month. Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Robert Costa report: NATO declined to say whether Stoltenberg would accept the invitation, saying that his schedule during his Washington trip in April will be announced in due course. The invitation could put the NATO leader in a slightly awkward position. Stoltenberg has gone to great lengths to foster a positive relationship with Trump. If the congressional invitation were seen as too direct a rebuke to the White House, it could suck him into a domestic U.S. political battle he has been eager to avoid. -- The Trump administration threatened to scale back its intelligence sharing with Germany if Berlin allows\u00a0the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to participate in the countrys development of a 5G network.The Wall Street Journals Bojan Pancevski and Sara Germano report: The threat marks the first time the U.S. has explicitly warned an ally that refusing to ostracize Huawei could lessen security cooperation with Washington. Both German and U.S. officials said the threat from Washington will unsettle Germanys security community, which is a big consumer of intelligence provided by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. information gatherers. -- The Trump administration has taken a harder-line approach to denuclearizing North Korea since the president's failed second summit with Kim Jong Un last month.\u00a0John Hudson reports: In remarks Monday, a top U.S. envoy said the United States would not lift sanctions on North Korea until it completely dismantles its nuclear and ballistic missiles. The United States is also seeking an end to Pyongyangs chemical and biological weapons, he said. Confronted with North Koreas insistence on major sanctions relief at the summit, the United States made a counterproposal demanding full sanctions relief for full denuclearization, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. -- Syrian government forces have frequently subjected male prisoners to sexual violence.

(Felicia Sonmez) -- Beto ORourke is expected to launch his presidential campaign very soon, even though he has not really prepared in the traditional way. The New York Timess Matt Flegenheimer and Lisa Lerer report: There has been no flirtation tour in Iowa, no trip to New Hampshire since his college years as an Ivy League rower. Mr. ORourke had no traditional campaign-in-waiting at the ready after the midterms Few doubt Mr. ORourkes capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fundraising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like [Biden and Sanders]. But perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as Mr. ORourke, and his drawn-out non-candidacy has provided few answers.\u00a0ORourke announced in a Twitter video that he would make his first visit to Iowa this weekend. -- Stacey Abrams, who also lost the Georgia gubernatorial\u00a0race last year, said\u00a0she could run for president in 2020\u00a0after saying previously that 2028 would be the earliest race she'd consider.\u00a0(CNN) -- Under fire, Facebook quickly reversed its decision to pull ads by Sen. Elizabeth Warrens campaign calling for the breakup of the social media giant. Politicos Cristiano Lima reports: The ads, which had identical images and text, touted Warren's recently announced plan to unwind anti-competitive tech mergers, including Facebooks acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. A message on the three ads said: This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook's advertising policies. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the ads had been taken down but said the company is in the process of restoring them. -- Related: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the agency of allowing Facebook and other tech giants to mishandle consumers private data. Tony Romm reports: Hawley said there is substantial evidence that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. -- Court packing is gaining currency among far-left activists, who in turn are trying to prod presidential candidates to embrace it.\u00a0Michael Scherer reports: Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who recently decided against running for president, became the latest figure to embrace an expansion of the nine-member court in recent talks at Yale Law School and Columbia University. [South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg] has also discussed a 15-justice structure for the court five Democratic appointees, five Republican appointees and five chosen by the other 10. The concept of expanding the Supreme Court, like the phrase court packing itself, fell into lengthy disrepute after 1937, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ... sought to add six friendlier justices, prompting an outcry even from allies.\u00a0 -- The strong showings of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the latest Iowa poll are impressive but shouldnt be overemphasized, Dan Balz writes: The poll should be read in two ways as a sign of initial strength for each of them, and as an indication of the vulnerabilities the two best-known figures in the race could face. With a big field assembling, those numbers Biden at 27 percent and Sanders at 25 percent are helpful but not overwhelmingly impressive. At every candidate event this year, there are more shoppers than buyers, and any number of candidates are drawing crowds and good reviews. Other candidates are and will have their moments. Still, it is notable that Biden and Sanders are where they are, given who they are. -- This week, Biden will address the International Association of Firefighters and the Delaware Democratic Party, two supportive audiences that will serve as the final test drive before the former vice president makes a 2020 decision. From NBC Newss Mike Memoli: The coming week may be a point of no return for him, as aides recognize that the partys patience is wearing thin. To the extent advisers identify any potential hurdles hes still reckoning with, they are parallel: how and when to engage with attacks from the most strident partisan voices in both parties, including Trump. No final decisions have been made on what Bidens campaign platform would be, but advisers said their starting point is similar to the one he sketched out when he considered joining the 2016 race which includes: \u00a0 A tax code overhaul to treat investment income as earned income. -- Many of New York Mayor Bill de Blasios closest aides are trying to talk him out of running for president.\u00a0Politicos Laura Nahmias and Sally Goldenberg report: As de Blasio touted his liberal record in Iowa and South Carolina in recent weeks, nearly three dozen former and current aides, consultants and allies ... panned the idea or doubted that the mayor would run for the Democratic nomination. Aside from the few people working on the nascent effort, only two said de Blasio should run. -- The large Democratic\u00a0field is stressing out a very specific group of people:\u00a0pollsters. Politico's Steven Shepard reports:\u00a0New surveys are cramming up to 23 Democrats into their questionnaires after the Democratic National Committee set a low, 1 percent polling threshold to gain admittance into the partys first primary debates. The miles-long list of candidates has created an unusual set of methodological challenges for pollsters already battling declining engagement with their surveys. ...\u00a0The 2020 race presents a different problem: which candidates to include.

The New York Timess Danny Hakim reports: Since its creation in 2016, it has adopted an increasingly apocalyptic, hard-right tone, warning of race wars, describing Barack Obama as a fresh-faced flower-child president, calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and comparing journalists to rodents. In recent weeks, in a rare airing of internal debate at the N.R.A., two prominent board members expressed concerns about NRATV.

Ltd., the expansive network of Canadian grocery brands, believes its recently acquired Farm Boy chain is what it needs to finally take on Ontario\u2019s biggest grocery markets. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a weapon like this to go at an area like the GTA,\u201d chief executive Michael Medline told analysts Wednesday following the release of Empire\u2019s third quarter results. \u201cOntario,\u201d he said, \u201chas historically been our Achilles heel.\u201d Empire, the parent to Sobeys, acquired Farm Boy, a chain of boutique groceries with a loyal following in eastern Ontario and popular line of private label products, for $800 million last year. At the time, Medline promised Farm Boy fans he wouldn\u2019t \u201cscrew this up,\u201d a reference to Empire\u2019s ill-fated acquisition of the western Safeway grocery chain, which alienated many long-time customers. While Medline suggested Wednesday that he does not want to expand Farm Boy too quickly, his ambitions for the brand were apparent. By combining Farm Boy with Empire\u2019s real estate \u201cprowess,\u201d Medline believes he can eventually \u201cblanket\u201d Toronto and its suburbs with stores. Farm Boy \u2014 now at 28 stores around Ontario \u2014 is already in the middle of an expansion in the Toronto area. The growth plans come as Empire enters the late stages of Project Sunrise, Medline\u2019s 2017 plan to cut costs and improve Empire\u2019s fortunes, which had been dragged down by the Safeway deal. One element of the plan involves expanding Empire\u2019s bargain brand, FreshCo, to meet rising demand for discount grocers. Empire is currently working to close 15 Safeway stores in B.C., converting 10 of them to FreshCo locations \u2014 part of a broader objective of converting 25 per cent of its network of 255 Safeway and Sobeys stores in Western Canada. Empire Co. Ltd. Michael MedlineCNW Group/Empire Co. Ltd. \u201cThat, to me, is the biggest question that grocers face,\u201d said Kevin Grier, an analyst who focuses on the grocery industry. Grier noted that it isn\u2019t a challenge that Sobeys faces alone. Other major chains, like Loblaw and Metro, are also caught in a shrinking middle ground, between the growth luxury brands like Whole Foods and discounters like Walmart. But Medline doesn\u2019t see it that way. First, he said, Farm Boy isn\u2019t part of that luxury category like Whole Foods. \u201cIt treats the customer so well, it perhaps it appears like that,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cBut it is not that.\u201d What it is, Medline said, is a flexible store format \u2014 25,000 sq-ft on average \u2014 that can squeeze into urban markets in a way that traditional, big-box grocers cannot. \u201cIt does more sales-per-square-feet than anyone else,\u201d he said. The description of the market \u2014 with discount and luxury stores luring customers away from conventional brands \u2014 doesn\u2019t fit with reality, Medline said. Shoppers, he said, aren\u2019t exclusively going to a discount store or a luxury store. They\u2019re going to whatever store fits their needs on any given day. Farm Boy, for instance, isn\u2019t where customers go for staples like toilet paper or tooth paste; it\u2019s for produce, meat and prepared food. Empire is expected to add a fourth option in spring 2020, when it starts offering grocery delivery in the Toronto area as part of a partnership with the U.K. grocery delivery company Ocado. Medline expects the e-commerce option to help Empire continue its push into urban and suburban Ontario. On Wednesday, Empire reported $6.24 billion in sales its third quarter, $218 million more than the previous year. Its adjusted earnings per share, however, dipped to $0.27 per share from $0.33 per share, which Empire attributed primarily to a one-time charge of $45 million ($0.12 per share).", "tags": ["discounters", "ocado", "previous year", "plan", "analyst"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Is the retail industry enjoying a renaissance?", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/86acdcd8-20a7-11e9-a46f-08f9738d6b2b"}, {"title": "Need a \u2018safe\u2019 place to wear your MAGA hat?

By the time we had our first daughter in 2009, we had around $50,000 in debt. It wasn't necessarily egregious debt since it was mostly car loans and student loans, but it sure sounded like a lot to me.   There's something about becoming a parent that makes even \"normal\" problems seem like a real emergency. One look into my daughter's eyes told me I didn't want to live a paycheck-to-paycheck existence. I wanted to take her on family vacations, to afford her every opportunity \u2014 and to help her reach her dreams.   Our new zero-sum budget took our regular, consistent income into account, making room for regular bills and estimating expenses in categories that fluctuate like food and transportation. We also made some adjustments \u2014 some big cuts \u2014 in areas where we had some control. We decided to limit food spending to $500 per month, for example, which meant no dining out. We also went on a spending freeze altogether so we could allocate our extra money toward debt repayment.   Because we earned a decent income at the time, it didn't take us long to make serious headway toward our car loans. We started by paying off the smallest loan first \u2014 an $8,000 car loan on my 2007 Dodge Caravan. From there, we focused on paying off the last $12,000 in loans on my husband's 2009 Toyota Prius. By the time our car loans were done, we were earning a lot more and demolishing our student loans at rapid pace.   By the time we paid off our final student loans, we hadn't dined out more than three or four times in the previous two years. We didn't have cable television, and we were shopping for clothing and thrift stores.   We also had a sense of purpose, especially since we had been dreaming a lot about our debt-free future. My husband and I saved saving several hundred dollars per month while we paid down debt, so we had quite the little nest egg for security.   While we were thrilled to become debt-free many years ago, that wasn't the only financial goal my husband and I wanted to accomplish. With more money at our disposal every month, we wanted to max out our retirement accounts every year and pay off our home extremely early.   Fortunately, these dreams have come true for us. We started maxing out our retirement accounts several years ago, but we also paid off our primary residence in early 2018. For the first time in our lives, we are 100% free of debt and beholden to no one. All we have to pay for each month are taxes, insurance, and basic living expenses.   But, we're still the same people we were before \u2014 even though we're earning more now and don't have many bills. My husband still drives the same 2009 Toyota Prius, and we even share it because we both work at home. We still don't have cable television and we still dine out infrequently because it's so darn expensive.   The biggest difference in our life is the fact that we save significantly more than we spend every month, and we're on the path toward a very early retirement. With no money stress to speak of, we're also much happier and more present parents than we dreamed we could be.   Marrying my husband was probably the best thing I ever did with my life, and having children is a very close second. But choosing a debt-free lifestyle is without a doubt the third most important thing I've ever done \u2014 both for myself and for my family.   New cars, restaurant meals, and home upgrades are always nice, but a debt-free lifestyle is the best gift money can buy. I don't have a new car or a lot of nice things, but I have one thing I would never trade away \u2014 the freedom to live life on my own terms.", "tags": ["look", "transportation", "children", "lot", "reach dreams"], "related_articles": [{"title": "A fifth of Americans say they have zero savings", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-with-zero-savings-at-20-2019-3"}, {"title": "This system helped this couple pay off $17,000 in student loans in less than a year", "source": "nbc-news", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/system-helped-these-newlyweds-pay-17-000-student-loans-less-ncna981896"}, {"title": "Tesla's Model Y is coming, but has this Model 3 owner's yearning been fulfilled?", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/03/14/tesla-model-y-unveil-has-elon-musk-satisfied-model-3-owner/3030203002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}]}, {"title": "Amazon eases price restrictions on third-party vendors", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-03-12T01:05:19Z", "origContent": "Amazon has dropped a requirement that third-party vendors who sell their wares on its website must always offer their lowest prices there, as the company faces intensifying criticism from partners and politicians. The move to end so-called price parity provisions, also known as \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d clauses, in the US comes amid calls for the company to be investigated under antitrust laws. The clauses, which prevented sellers from listing products sold on Amazon\u2019s Marketplace for cheaper elsewhere online, had been dropped in Europe in 2013 after the UK and Germany launched investigations into the policy. Third-party sales on Amazon\u2019s Marketplace, where outside sellers list their products alongside items sold directly by Amazon, now account for half of all items sold on its website. The ecommerce company, which captures half of US online retail sales, is coming under increasing scrutiny for its perceived dominance and treatment of sellers, against a broader backdrop of criticism of the power of big technology companies. Last week, Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic consumer champion known for taking on Wall Street, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if she is successful in her attempt to become US president. Ms Warren said she would introduce legislation that prevented companies such as Amazon from operating a marketplace and participating in that marketplace. James Thomson, a former Amazon manager who consults sellers on the ecommerce platform, said the decision to axe price parity provisions could result in slower growth for Amazon. \u201cThe Marketplace has been historically a cash cow for Amazon. If it becomes less competitive on price and consumers become less loyal, does that mean the third-party business is going to slow down?\u201d he said. The explosive growth of the Marketplace has helped propel the company\u2019s growth and provided an economic model with more attractive margins than Amazon\u2019s own sales of goods. The company takes a cut of sales and charges merchants fees for fulfilment, payment and advertising services, but does not bear the cost and risk of purchasing and holding inventory. Revenue from those services grew twice as fast in the fourth quarter from a year ago as Amazon\u2019s own online sales. But Marketplace has also provided fodder for critics who argue that Amazon has too much leverage over sellers and uses the data it gleans from all the sales that go across its platform to benefit its own business. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager last year launched an investigation into how Amazon uses data about its merchants. Germany\u2019s antitrust watchdog has opened a separate probe into the company\u2019s \u201cdouble role\u201d as a retailer and marketplace for sellers and whether the company abused its market power to set illegal contract terms. Such concerns have also started to emerge in the US, particularly among Democrats. In December, Richard Blumenthal, a senator from Connecticut, wrote to the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission urging regulators to investigate Amazon\u2019s contract provisions, which he said \u201ccould stifle market competition and artificially inflate prices on consumer goods\u201d. After Amazon\u2019s move on Monday, Mr Blumenthal said the \u201cwise and welcome decision comes only after aggressive advocacy and attention that compelled Amazon to abandon its abusive contract clause\u201d, adding: \u201cI remain deeply troubled that federal regulators responsible for cracking down on anti-competitive practices seem asleep at the wheel, at great cost to American innovation and consumers.\u201d", "tags": ["richard blumenthal", "sales", "justice", "fourth quarter", "senator"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Amazon shoppers may be able to get a lower price on some items elsewhere, report says", "source": "usa-today", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/03/11/amazon-let-third-party-sellers-charge-lower-prices-elsewhere/3135231002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable"}, {"title": "Amazon is ending its restrictive pricing practice", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ends-restrictive-pricing-parity-2019-3"}, {"title": "The Technology 202: EU's top competition cop says Amazon probe in 'quite advanced' stage", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/03/12/the-technology-202-eu-s-top-competition-cop-says-amazon-probe-in-quite-advanced-stage/5c86f5271b326b2d177d6057/"}]}, {"title": "Gunmaker must face lawsuit over Sandy Hook killings", "source": "financial-times", "date": "2019-03-14T20:07:26Z", "origContent": "Connecticut\u2019s top court has dealt the US gun industry a rare legal defeat, ruling that families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting may sue Remington, the company that made the military-style weapon that killed 20 first-grade children and six adults.  By a 5-4 majority, the Connecticut Supreme Court allowed the families to pursue their claim that Remington\u2019s marketing had extolled \u201cthe militaristic and assaultive qualities\u201d of the Bushmaster XM15-E2S semi-automatic rifle used in the 2012 massacre, rather than simply promoting it for hunting and recreational use.  The ruling represents a victory for gun control advocates, exposing the oldest gun maker to a court case in which families would request access to internal company documents.  \u201cThis is incredibly important,\u201d said David Wheeler, whose son Ben was among those who died at Sandy Hook. \u201cEvery step of the way Remington has blocked any attempt to be able to look at their internal communications and marketing strategy and one must wonder why.\u201d The court\u2019s decision adds to pressure on the gun industry, which has experienced falling sales since Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 eased gun enthusiasts\u2019 fears of tighter regulation. US firearm sales last month dropped 12 per cent from a year earlier to 1.2m, according to an estimate from Small Arms Analytics. The industry also faces growing restrictions on its distribution and public protests that have prompted other companies to distance themselves. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, one of the biggest US sports retailers, said this week that it would stop selling firearms at 125 of its stores \u201cwhere the category underperforms\u201d. Walmart and Kroger decided last year to stop selling guns to people under 21. Dick\u2019s had already stopped selling assault-style rifles and ended gun sales to under-21s after the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last year.  Remington, controlled by Cerberus, the private equity group, filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, emerging last May with its debt reduced.  The bankruptcy delayed the Connecticut case, which pivots on the interpretation of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a 2005 federal law that offers firearms manufacturers broad protection from liability for the criminal use of their products but allows exceptions for harmful marketing. \u201cOnce we accept the premise that Congress did not intend to immunise firearms suppliers who engage in truly unethical and irresponsible marketing practices\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it falls to a jury to decide whether the promotional schemes alleged in the present case rise to the level of illegal trade practices and whether fault for the tragedy can be laid at their feet,\u201d the court\u2019s majority ruling concluded. \u201cIt seemed kind of unbelievable that this industry would enjoy that kind of protection from liability\u201d under PLACA, Mr Wheeler said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to look at this [ruling] and think the states are perhaps swinging to a more sensible place.\u201d Democrats welcomed the Connecticut ruling as a significant breakthrough in a gun control debate that splits Washington largely along party lines. \u201cThis blockbuster decision is really a \u2018wow\u2019 moment in American legal history. It will seismically shift the legal landscape for gun violence victims,\u201d said Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut senator.  Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were among the candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination who welcomed the victory for the Sandy Hook families. \u201cThe last election was kind of remarkable in that candidates were speaking openly about sensible gun regulation,\u201d Mr Wheeler said: \u201cI fully expect that will continue [in 2020] to some degree because these horrible events continue to happen.\u201d", "tags": ["federal law", "sporting goods", "party lines", "ruling", "dick"], "related_articles": [{"title": "PewDiePie responds with horror after reports that New Zealand mosque shooter yelled 'subscribe to Pewdiepie' during attack", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-responds-reports-new-zealand-mosque-shooter-subscribe-2019-3"}, {"title": "Dick's Sporting Goods Plunges as Analysts Weigh Turnaround", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-12/dick-s-sporting-goods-falls-as-gross-margin-trails-estimate"}, {"title": "The Daily 202: Russia may experiment with new forms of interference in Ukraine\u2019s elections, experts warn", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/03/13/daily-202-russia-may-experiment-with-new-forms-of-interference-in-ukraine-s-elections-experts-warn/5c87d39a1b326b2d177d6060/"}]}, {"title": "Facebook\u2019s About-Face", "source": "fortune", "date": "2019-03-14T10:30:36Z", "origContent": "Mark Zuckerberg wants to talk about how Facebook is changing. It is early February, and the 34-year-old CEO sits on a couch in his glass-walled conference room in Facebooks newest complex, a Frank Gehrydesigned structure that features a 3.6-acre rooftop garden and 40-foot redwoods. Zuckerberg summarizes Facebooks changes around four big categories that weve focused on, all with the subtext of the immense criticism his company has faced over more than two incredibly difficult years. One category, he says, is content governance, helping to balance free expression and safety. He continues, Another is principles around data privacy and, in a world where everyone is sharing a lot of information, what are the right ways to go about protecting that and giving people control. Zuckerbergs last two categories are digital health and well-being, a nod to device proliferation and screen-time overload, and election integrity and preventing interference. The talking points amount to Zuckerbergs apology tour for all the damage Facebook has wrought. On the way to building an empire worth half-a-trillion dollars, he and his company have connected friends old and new, sure, but they have also inadvertently found themselves in the middle of controversies from hate speech to data breaches. Zuckerberg wants to show that he gets it. Facebook, he says, is moving from a reactive model of how were handling this stuff to one where we are building systems to get out ahead. A month later it becomes apparent that Zuckerberg has been rehearsing his lines, the tech-mogul equivalent of a comedian trying out material at open-mic night. In a much-heralded post on Facebook in early March, Zuckerberg announced his company would build new privacy-friendly messaging products, moving from a town square approach to one more akin to a living room conversation. People should have simple, intimate places where they have clear control over who can communicate with them and confidence that no one else can access what they share, he wrote. In other words, they should have a place to communicate that is nothing like Facebook. Change is a complicated topic for Facebook. On the one hand, it certainly is doing a ton to address its problems, like hiring tens of thousands of workers to police its content. Yet on the other hand, for the foreseeable future, Facebook will remain exactly what it has been over the past decade-plus of its meteoric rise: a publishing platform that gathers data on its 2.3 billion users for the benefit of its marketer customers, who helped Facebook record $56 billion in revenues last year. Facebook may be changing, but it aims to preserve what its got until it figures out a way to replace the business too much change would jeopardize. Mike Schroepfer, Facebooks chief technology officer, is pointing to two side-by-side images on his laptop, asking me to identify the good from the bad. The answer isnt obvious. Both pictures look convincingly cannabis-likedense, leafy-green buds that are coated with miniature, hair-like growths, or perhaps mold. Finally, I make a semi-educated guess: The one on the left is marijuana? Schroepfer nods approvingly. People are as much a part of Facebooks solutions to its problems as computers. It has tripled its number of content moderators, contractors it hires to monitor postings in Facebooks News Feed section, from 10,000 in 2017 to 30,000 today. At the higher end of the organizational chart, Facebook also has beefed up the hiring and redeploying of experts who address specific issues with the information its users see. Molly Cutler, Facebooks former associate general counsel, now leads a strategic response team that meets weekly with chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. Samidh Chakrabarti, the companys head of civic engagement, has shifted his focus from voter registration to preventing election interference. Facebook has reassigned engineers in its once separate safety and security group to be embedded in individual product teams. Such fixes are real, yet they are designed to improve Facebook, not to fundamentally change it. Removing terrorist propaganda is a crowd pleaser, argues Gene Munster, a veteran analyst with Loup Ventures, especially compared with the thornier issue of what Facebook does with its users data. They like talking about that because its fixable, he says. In fact, Facebook argues that beyond the bad actors it unintentionally allowed onto its network, it doesnt even have a problem to fix. Instead, it maintains that if only its advertising model were better understood, particularly by the public, its problems would be diminished. It is core to our business, says Sandberg, of Facebooks holy trinity of user data, advertiser payments, and free content. And it is the hardest to explain. It is core to our business. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg on Facebooks business of ad sales, user targeting, and free services Whether or not the masses can pay to use online services, Facebook undeniably faces a rich world/poor world conundrum. Its growth is in the latter, but its profitability lies in the former. Last year the number of overall users grew 9%, much of the growth coming from outside its mature markets. Facebook said it makes an average of nearly $35 quarterly on each user in the U.S. and Canada, more than 10 times what it collects in the Asia Pacific region. From a financial perspective, at least, the growth is in the wrong part of the world. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where [average per-user revenue] is relatively lower, the company said in its 10-K annual report, filed in January. Sandberg professes to be unconcerned about the trend. We dont \u00adreally prioritize countries and user growth based on monetization opportunities, she says. We want to connect everyone. The geographic mix is just one macro issue buffeting Facebooks business. Its newer enterprises, including Instagram (purchased in 2012 for $1 billion) and WhatsApp (acquired for $22 billion in 2014) havent yet translated into big revenue opportunities, though \u00adInstagram has been growing rapidly. Whats\u00adApp, in particular, has huge global reachit has 1.5 billion users worldwide but no obvious business model. What began as Facebook.com, the original Facebook, has become positively becalmed. The majority of growth is coming from Instagram, with core Facebook revenue growth likely to hit high single digits sometime next year, Stifel analyst Scott Devitt writes to clients. He says other Internet companies make for better investments. In 2012, Usama Fayyad enlisted two French Ph.D.s in an ambitious project. Their task was to figure out just how accurately Facebook could determine an individual users purchasing behavior, based on the data available to the growing Silicon Valley company, which had about a billion users at the time. He made himself the subject of the study. Fayyad was no random sample. Nearly a decade earlier, he had been Yahoos first chief data officer after the then-booming Internet company acquired his data-mining startup, DMX Group. Yahoo grew its ad business from $20 million to $500 million during Fayyads time there, pioneering the use of behavioral targeting of users. Now, as the chief technology officer of Blue Kangaroo, a personalized shopping app for mobile devices, he was trying to assess the effectiveness of Facebooks ads. (Spoiler alert: They were, and are, extremely effective.) They like talking about [policing content] because thats whats fixable. Gene Munster, analyst, Loup Ventures In the years since Fayyads study, Facebooks ability to target customers has only improved as its data sources have grown. Much of that additional data has come from Facebook itself, via new features like Facebook Live, its live-streaming video service, or the launch of Reactions, a more nuanced version of the Like button that allows users to express love, sadness, anger, and other emotional responses to content on the platform. (The videos that users watch and their reactions to all sorts of content can tell marketers a lot about who they are.) But the company also accumulated all sorts of other data sources from third-party providers eager to share the spoils. Facebook proved unable to control how the mix of third-party information and its own data got used, such as when political researcher Cambridge Analytica violated Facebooks rules, the company says, to harvest and act on Facebook user profiles. The ensuing firestorm began to chip away at Facebooks credibilityeven with the marketers who get so much value from the ads they buy on its platform. Facebook then hurt more than its reputation when it decided to cut off the third-party data providers. They really shot themselves in the foot, says Allen Finn, a marketing specialist with online advertising consultancy WordStream. Theyve dampened the ability to do ad targeting following Cambridge Analytica. The changes have hurt\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adbut have not crippledthe effectiveness of Facebooks ads because there are ways clever ad-tech specialists can combine Facebooks data with third-party data. As these changes took place, we had to renavigate a little bit, says Laura Joukovski, chief media officer at TechStyle Fashion Group, an online retailer. Facebook believes one way to improve trust on the part of users is to help them better understand Facebook itself. The theory is that if consumers understand how ads work, theyll continue to view them as a positive aspect of the Facebook experience. Consumersand its not their faultdo not understand how digital advertising works, says Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions. One of the ways Facebook is trying to shed light on its advertising model is by letting users click on individual ads to find out why theyre being put in front of them. But the Why am I seeing this? button doesnt go into much detail, providing cursory information such as suggesting a retailer wants to reach people of a certain age in a given location. Facebook says it is still working out the kinks to the Why am I seeing this? feature and is in the process of allowing for much greater transparency and data controls. For example, it has announced it will offer a Clear History button that gives users the ability to erase their activity, much as web browser software has allowed for years. The tweaks add up to just enough changes, more grist for the argument that Facebook is adaptingbut only as little as possible. If Facebook does change in more fundamental ways, it will be because it has to, not because it wants to. In 2020, the first-ever state data-privacy law will take effect in California, unless Congress can hurriedly pass a law to preempt it nationwide. The so-called California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is one of the most stringent sets of rules that could soon put unprecedented restrictions on Facebook and companies like it. The law would give consumers much more control over their data, allowing them to see what online information is being collected on them and how its being used. Theyll also be able to hit delete on their online informationa kind of Clear History button but for the entire Internet. Its a high bar that pretty much no one in the tech industry wants to meet. California Governor Gavin Newsom wants to take it a step further. I applaud this legislature for passing the first-in-the-nation digital privacy law last year, he said in his first State of the State Address in mid-February. But Californias consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data. Californias consumers should be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data. California Governor Gavin Newsom Newsoms proposal is a data dividend that would require Internet companies to pay users for use of their information, and hes not the only one supporting it. Some, like Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, are calling for companies like Facebook to be broken up. At this point, Facebooks best hope is that federal regulations come together faster than state-led laws, as the Internet industry hopes the fed rules will end up being more lenient. Either way, the upcoming restrictions will have a lasting impact on Facebook. The company is already seeing the repercussions of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The new laws aim to give European consumers more control over their online information, requiring companies to gain consent from users before utilizing certain types of data. Failure to comply can result in fines up to 4% of a companys annual revenuemore than $2 billion, in Facebooks case. Even worse, the laws can cut into the companys ability to sell targeted ads. With GDPR, says Sandberg, theres a percentage of people in Europe that have opted out of certain kinds of targeting. Those ads are going to be less relevant. In other words, the Internet industry, including Facebook, already is taking a financial hit there. The regulatory changes promise to have a cumulative effect. Historically, what advertisers use Facebook for is its broad reach and extremely specific targeting capabilities, says Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst with researcher eMarketer. It is true that those targeting capabilities are starting to be chipped away from GDPR. Its a process that could accelerate with similar moves around the world, including in Washington, D.C. Says Stifels Scott Devitt: Facebooks management team has created too many adversariespoliticians, regulators, tech leaders, consumers, and employeesto not experience long-term negative ramifications on its business. The discussion of Facebooks travails often toggles back to its past travails and what a canny, wise-beyond-his-years operator Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly has proved to be. He resisted early calls to sell his company. (Yahoo offered $1 billion in 2006.) He weathered user outrage over various design changes. In 2012 he successfully converted Facebook from a desktop-PC web program to a mobile app, a feat that required a complete retooling of its development process. Facebook has already circled the globe looking for users. It has saturated the markets that are most profitable for the company, and now it needs to turn to additional ways of making money. If the future is in private messages or pictures that auto-delete, then Facebook wants to be there too. Ive always tried to run the company in a way that were willing to take on more costs or lower revenuein order to get to what I think will be the better thing over time, he says, previewing the painful changes the companys new products will require. But I just think getting to the right model over time is going to help build a stronger community. Make no mistake. Zuckerberg doesnt just mean stronger for users, or society, or lawmakers. He means stronger for Facebook.

My proposal will still let any consumer go to Amazon and order a coffee maker for delivery within 48 hours, go to Google and look up the capital of North Dakota and go to Facebook and check out what their old college friends are up to. I propose to separate that platform that consumers use from the ancillary business products that Amazon and Google are able to unfairly promote and that has the consequence of stamping out little businesses, medium-size businesses, start-up businesses. I want to protect competition. The giants cant use the advantage of the platform to wipe out all the competition for what gets sold on the platform. Warren:\u00a0It's not even hard. Right now 49 percent of all retail sales come to Amazon. For comparison, about 9 percent of physical retail sales go to Walmart. Any small business that wants to do online retail pretty much has to be on Amazon. They go to Amazon right now, and they're on the platform and Amazon sucks up information about every buyer and every seller. When it spots a profitable business, it has the option of moving in on that profitable business's space, undercutting them maybe only temporarily\u00a0 on price, moving where they appear on the platform back to page 9, and killing off the competitor business and sucking up the business for themselves.\u00a0 Tech 202: But for consumers, if Amazon is offering a lower price ... Warren:\u00a0Temporarily. That's what they did with Diapers.com. This is another feature of the problem. (Note from Tech 202: Though Warren's focus has been on small businesses who sell via Amazon's website, she used an example of Diapers.com, a would-be\u00a0e-commerce competitor, to show how Amazon cuts prices to compete.) Warren:\u00a0It's not on the Amazon website, so this is a little bit of a different example of what goes on.\u00a0It lowers its price to below cost. There's no way Diapers.com can survive it. The business strategy [from Amazon] is to lower our price enough that Diapers.com just can't make it. After they make this announcement, they offer to buy Diapers.com. Diapers.com agrees because they have two choices, get sold or die. They let themselves get sold, they make some money on the sale, and Amazon no longer has a competitor. The price of diapers goes back up.\u00a0\u00a0 Warren:\u00a0Yes. I've been working on antitrust issues for years. This is part of an extension of other legislation that I've introduced, other speeches that I've given, other policy papers I've put out. It's part of a much larger piece about protecting competition and not permitting industry giants to snuff out competition.\u00a0 Warren:\u00a0Yup, I'm already on record on that. These are all related to each other.\u00a0 Warren:\u00a0I'm not in Washington to work for the billionaires. I'm in Washington to try to make government work for everyone else.\u00a0 Warren:\u00a0We use the same tools as everyone else, and we worry about those tools the same way as everyone else. Facebook is an example of the problem we've got. Facebook looked over and saw that people were migrating off Facebook over to WhatsApp. They had two choices, they could get better, which is what happens in a competitive market. Or they could use their enormous size to buy WhatsApp and then suck all of the data out of WhatsApp. They chose the second path. I propose that merger be unwound. That would give consumers an option.\u00a0 Venture capital right now refers to the area around Facebook, Amazon and Google as the 'kill zone' because small businesses and start-ups that get too close and look like they might compete with those giants for business get killed. Investment is going down.\u00a0 Warren:\u00a0I think what we have right now is the unintended consequence. The giants are destroying competition in one area after another. It's the job of law to enforce the rules to stop them. That's how competition will flourish in this marketplace. The country had to do this 120 years ago. We need to do it again.\u00a0 Warren's proposal to break up Big Tech sparked heated debate on social media, where many technologists criticized her proposal.\u00a0 Several venture capitalists circulated a criticism of the proposal from the blog Truth on the Market.

It's Cloudera's first earnings report since closing the $5.2 billion merger with smaller rival Hortonworks. The company said that the combined entity will generate revenue of up to $190 million in the first quarter and as much as $855 million for the year. Not all analysts have published estimates for the combined company, but some of those who have were expecting bigger numbers. Analysts at BTIG predicted in a note on Tuesday that sales would reach $207 million in the first quarter and $940 million for the year. D.A. Davidson analysts said last week that revenue this calendar year (one month off from Cloudera's fiscal year) would be $920 million. Cloudera and Hortonworks, the two most prominent vendors of Hadoop open-source software, came together so they could cut down on the costs of going head-to-head and join forces in taking on Amazon Web Services, which is bolstering its database offerings. The shares had gained 32 percent this year as of Wednesday's close. \"The elimination of the massive product overlap between the two companies could drive increasing standardization of the Hadoop stack and therefore remove barriers to consumption, which in turn could increase demand,\" wrote Edward Parker of BTIG, who has a \"buy\" rating on the stock. But making money remains a challenge. Cloudera forecast a first-quarter loss, excluding some items, of up to 25 cents a share and as high as 36 cents a share for the year, according to a statement. Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly said on the call with analysts on Wednesday that the teams have been combined but there are still administrative and other developments in the works. \"From an operations perspective, only back office systems integration and facilities consolidation remain,\" Reilly said. For the fourth quarter, ending Jan. 31, Cloudera reported a loss of 15 cents a share on revenue of $144.5 million.

And now, it\u2019s facing the wrath of two major shareholders. In a letter to the GameStop board, Permit Capital Enterprise Fund and Hestia Capital Partners, which together own 1.3% of GameStop, said that the company needs to replace its \u201cstale board\u201d and increase stock buybacks to return more value to shareholders, according to The Wall Street Journal, which obtained a copy of the letter. They shared concerns that GameStop isn\u2019t doing enough to compete in the hotly contested retail market. Surveying the last five years, we struggle to identify any significant steps the company has takenbesides the introduction of collectiblesto adapt to disruptive dynamics in its core business,\u201d the investors wrote, according to the Journal. GameStop has found itself in increasingly troubled waters. Video game players, which have historically been the lifeblood of GameStop\u2019s business, now have many more places to buy games and are increasingly turning to digital copies they can buy on consoles, cutting GameStop out of the purchasing equation. Even among players who buy physical game copies and hardware, online retailers like Amazon and others continue to be a drag on GameStop\u2019s business. In response, GameStop has transitioned its business to add more collectibles, used cell phones, and other products to its stores. In its last fiscal quarter ended November, GameStop sales rose nearly 5% to $2 billion, but its losses widened to $488.6 million. While those issues have been enough to scare investors, GameStop also sought potential suitors last year. The company\u2019s executives ultimately abandoned the plan after announcing that no suitable buyers for GameStop\u2019s business had come along.

West Virginia legislators want stiffer penalties for the offense. If Gov. Jim Justice signs SB 238, approved by lawmakers during their regular session, fines for passing stopped school buses with their warning lights flashing would double. Justice should sign the measure, of course. It would provide fines of up to $1,000 for first offenders plus as much as six months in jail. Subsequent infractions carry higher punishment. Many school bus drivers have been forced to take special measures to protect the children under their care. That is why motorists often notice that when buses stop to pick up or let off children, the big yellow vehicles are positioned to at least partially block the lane of traffic that could be used to pass them. In view of the frequency with which people pass stopped buses, it is something of a miracle that more children have not been injured by the scofflaws. So the increased penalties are welcome. Law enforcement officers should make arrests each and every time they catch someone disobeying the law on stopped school buses. And magistrates and other judges dealing with those who place our children at risk should throw the book, now heavier, at them. This year's regular session of the West Virginia Legislature ended Saturday night with the usual flurry of last-minute action to beat the midnight deadline. As usual, talk during the session was dominated by high-profile and highly controversial pieces of legislation such as school choice and concealed carry on campus. However, the Legislature also acted on a range of little-known and seldom-discussed bills, some of which will improve the lives or West Virginians, or at least make them a little easier. Among them, assuming Gov. Jim Justice signs them into law, as noted in Sunday's Gazette-Mail: HB 2083 compels the state to issue identification cards to people released from prison. Not having ID can be a huge hindrance in finding work or establishing a life on the outside. HB 2583 will allow pharmacists to dispense birth control to people over 18 under a statewide prescription by the state health officer. SB 622 increases the limit that people may contribute to political campaigns. The new limit is $2,800 for both the primary and general election cycles. People will be able to buy stronger beer if they so desire. SB 529 increases the maximum alcohol content from 12 percent to 15 percent. A resolution asks the secretary of Transportation to authorize the raising of the speed limit, where appropriate, to 75 mph. If nothing else, this will make the law conform to what people are already driving. In some parts of Interstate 64, the normal speed is 80 mph, but that's too high to make legal, at least for now. Justice has already signed HB 2459, which lifts a ban on people convicted of drug crimes from receiving SNAP benefits. He also signed a bill that allows Sunday sales of liquor. In short, the Legislature made it easier to drink alcohol, buy birth control, start a new life after prison and drive the normal cruising speed on the interstate without having to worry about those flashing blue lights. Meanwhile, auto dealers will be allowed to sell older and high-mileage used cars \"as is\" without the usual warranty. How that helps the dealer is obvious. How that helps consumers is not so easy to understand. For the most part, the Legislature decided to get out of the way of West Virginians enjoying life. But just a little. More needs to be done, but for now, small steps are welcome in expectations larger ones will be on the agenda next year. West Virginia lawmakers will spend the next several weeks learning what they can about public education, in preparation for a special session they will hold on the topic later this spring. The more facts they can gather and the more opinions they can hear the better. To that end, the state Department of Education plans a series of seven public forums on schools. The first will be held Monday in Cabell County. It appears as though no forum has been scheduled for the Mid-Ohio Valley but events in Harrison County and Wheeling are also close enough that local residents should be able to make the trip. (Dates and times for those other events have not been announced.) Local residents had plenty to say on the matters at hand, when they were under scrutiny during the legislative session. Those who genuinely have insight and questions should take advantage of this opportunity. It is not going too far to say that the upcoming legislative session is aimed at foundational improvements in public education. And that means, of course, that those bent on simply complaining without offering a solution or trolling lawmakers should stay far, far away. Attending one of the nearby meetings may be the best opportunity for the rest of us to positively affect the process.", "tags": ["more children", "transportation", "justice", "law", "time"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Georgia editorial roundup", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/b13b5ec292da41eabd7e84e776b3db92"}, {"title": "Bomb cyclone bolts toward Upper Midwest after blasting the Colorado and the Plains", "source": "the-washington-post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/03/14/bomb-cyclone-bolts-toward-upper-midwest-after-blasting-colorado-plains/"}, {"title": "Colorado Editorial Roundup", "source": "associated-press", "url": "https://apnews.com/36942e6b2ee84085b744227437773701"}]}, {"title": "Walmart and Kroger are rethinking stores as the online grocery battle intensifies (WMT, KR)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-03-15T17:53:55Z", "origContent": "Walmart and Kroger are rethinking their brick-and-mortar store strategies in the face of growing competition from Amazon for shoppers' online grocery spending.   Both Walmart and Kroger fulfill online orders from stores. As the popularity of online grocery grows, store aisles can get hectic with a rush of employees trying to fill those orders.   \"We got into this discussion actually on Monday at our office meeting where one of our senior folks was saying, 'I hate shopping in the store on Sunday trying to get up and down the aisles,'\" Walmart US CEO Greg Foran said recently during a UBS conference.   Starbucks faced a similar issue two years ago after introducing mobile order and pay, which allows customers to order and pay ahead. It led to excessively long lines in stores, which alienated many customers. The company ultimately addressed the problem by redesigning its stores.   Walmart, which offers online grocery pickup at more than 2,100 stores, is now considering adding automation to its stores that could help with fulfilling orders, Foran said. The company may also place a cap on the number of orders stores can fulfill at once.   Kroger is ahead of the game in anticipating this point of friction. Last year, the company signed a deal with Ocado to build automated warehouses, called sheds, for filling online grocery orders. The first of the sheds will open within the next two years.   Even after the sheds open, however, Kroger's stores will continue to fulfill online orders \u2014 particularly those orders with a short turnaround for delivery or pickup, Kroger's chief digital officer Yael Cosset told Business Insider in an interview.  In the meantime, Kroger can alleviate pressure on stores with high rates of online orders by shifting fulfillment to neighboring Kroger locations, he said.   Kroger is also testing a number of different fulfillment models with Ocado in addition to the sheds, and the grocer has considered designating a separate area within its stores for picking online orders \"so it doesn't create a distraction for the brick-and-mortar customer,\" Cosset said.   Cosset called the online fulfillment equation a \"balancing act,\" which he said is informed by the vast amount of data Kroger collects on shopper activity.   \"We have the benefit of 2,800 stores today with over 12 million families visiting those stores every day,\" he said. \"We know what the trends are in terms of specific choices for products or food or flavors. We know more about the next yogurt trend or ice cream trend than many of our competitors just because of the volume of interactions we have with our customers and our commitment to listening to what they tell us.\"   This knowledge gives Kroger an \"additional lens\" that allows for precise forecasting of demand for online orders, he said. Kroger currently offers online grocery pickup or delivery to 91% of its customers.   \"That data allows us to not only balance the fulfillment [process] ... but also plan the next evolution of our network,\" Cosset said.   Kroger and Walmart are trailing Amazon in the battle for shoppers' online grocery spending. Amazon led the pack in 2017 with an online grocery market share of 12.5%, followed by Walmart with an 11.1% share and Kroger with a 6.4% share, according to a 2018 Deutsche Bank report.  Walmart's changing strategy around its store design applies to more than just the grocery department.   Fulfillment centers, on the other hand, are all about \"efficiency, footsteps, and pick rates,\" he said. Pick rates refers to the time it takes to fulfill an online order.   \"Getting that blend right is something that we are challenging ourselves with at the moment,\" Foran said, noting that \"lots more changes\" are coming.

Here\u2019s how the retail giant is implementing the new system. (WMT)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-03-14T14:08:12Z", "origContent": "There are two factors that Greg Smith, executive vice president of supply chain at Walmart US, keeps at the top of his mind when overseeing and innovating the retail giant's huge logistics network: improving precision and reducing costs.   \"Not only are we trying to find ways to keep our costs lower, so we can continue to fulfill our mission of everyday low prices, but we're also looking to see how we can control the cycle times and the precision of that service,\" Smith told Business Insider.   \"We want to be as efficient as we can from a cost standpoint, but we also as controlled as we possibly can on timing,\" he added.   And when it comes to making sure Walmart's 5,000-plus US locations are fully stocked, Smith and his team have found a new way to ensure goods are getting to shelves more quickly than ever.   Walmart is opening a 340,000-square-foot consolidation center in Colton, Calif., about 57 miles east of Los Angeles, that will use automated technology to receive and process goods more quickly than its existing consolidation centers. The Colton center will shave two to five days off the fulfillment process, Smith said.   Walmart has ten consolidation centers nationwide. Those massive centers take products from suppliers, and then sort them to Walmart's 42 regional distribution centers. From those distribution centers, shipments go to Walmart stores.  Right now, consolidation centers divide their orders from suppliers into 42 parts to correspond with the 42 different distribution centers. Walmart doesn't have to do that with its larger suppliers, but smaller companies and manufacturers need those orders split up.   But that process is unwieldy, and Smith said with new automated technology the orders don't need to be divided.   Historically where we would have 42 different orders, we'll have one consolidated order that will come to our automated receiving.   We will then dynamically allocate it based on our most recent information, then we will divide it into 42 different locations from there \u2014 but the supplier will have one order, one invoice, and one shipment to our location.   Right now, Walmart's consolidation center in Desoto, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, is processing orders like this manually. This process will be implemented in the Colton center when it opens in July.   Then, Smith said, the new consolidation process will be implemented across Walmart's network.   It's one of several automated processes Walmart is implementing in its supply chain to make sure goods arrive quickly in stores.   Last year, Walmart launched automatic inbound scheduling so that suppliers could arrange deliveries at Walmart grocery distribution centers without any back-and-forth. More than 97% of Walmart suppliers are now able to arrange deliveries through that new system.   Smith said that will be expanded to regional distribution centers by the end of this year.   And a high-tech Walmart grocery distribution center, set to open in 2020 in Schafter, Calif., will be able to process 40% more goods.   \"As we adapt to what our needs are in this faster and more precise supply chain, we've made a lot of changes this past year,\" Smith said.", "tags": ["orders", "calif.", "los angeles", "walmart", "texas"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Walmart and Kroger are rethinking stores as the online grocery battle intensifies (WMT, KR)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-kroger-stores-grocery-battle-vs-amazon-2019-3"}, {"title": "Walmart upped its distribution center productivity by 13% in the last year and a half \u2014 and it wasn't by telling employees to 'work harder'", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-increased-distribution-center-productivity-13-percent-2019-3"}, {"title": "Walmart US is increasingly relying on its 8,600 'Elite Fleet' truckers over third-parties \u2014 and it's the latest move from America's largest company to take charge of its transportation network (WMT)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-truckers-over-third-parties-2019-3"}]}, {"title": "Walmart US CEO asked workers to email him their biggest complaints, and a surprising theme emerged from the deluge of 2,700 messages he got in return (WMT)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-03-13T14:30:05Z", "origContent": "Walmart US CEO Greg Foran stood on a stage at a company holiday meeting five years ago and asked thousands of workers to email him.

In 2015, millennials drank 42% of all wine consumed in the US. This prompted winemakers to meet them in their territory \u2014 online.   Online beer, liquor, and wine sales jumped 33% in 2017.   And from 2016 to January of this year, wine accounted for 65% of all online alcohol sales \u2014 totally eclipsing beer and spirits.   And the way wine is being packaged has changed too. Canned wine sales increased 125.2%, from $6.4 million in 2015 to $14.5 million in 2016.   In fact, over half of all Americans said they'd choose a drink on their couch over one at a bar. In-home drinkers prefer it because it's more relaxing, cheaper, and personal.   And millennials love a bargain. While we're drinking more wine by volume, Gen Xers are still spending more money on the stuff.   But 75% of millennials surveyed said that if they had more money to spend on wine, they would. But we don't.   That may be why companies like Walmart are buying up their own private wine labels. At $11 a bottle, the bargain brand is still priced higher than its competitors. But Walmart's senior wine buyer says the bottles will \"drink like a $30 or $40 bottle of wine.\"   In 2017, the US bottled a total of 717,866,271 bottles of wine. But Silicon Valley Bank predicts that the wine industry might be at the tail end of a 20-year growth period. They expect premium wine sales to only grow 4-8%, compared to the 10-14% in 2017.

Hungarian model Palvin, who appeared in the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, announced the news to fans on Thursday via Instagram.   The announcement comes just days after a Victoria's Secret Instagram post featuring Palvin gained attention and was praised by customers for being more body-positive. This could signal that the struggling retailer is beginning to listen to its critics.   While Palvin is not a plus-size model, Instagrammers celebrated the post for being more body-inclusive, as they perceived her to be curvier than some of its other models.   \"This model actually looks healthy..& I'm loving it!\" one Instagram user wrote.   \"At last! A real human body,\" another said.  A group of Bernstein analysts, led by Jamie Merriman, was quick to point out how successful the post has been.   \"While this was just one Instagram post, not even Palvin's first for the brand, and not one that actually featured a plus-sized model, it demonstrates that the customer does respond to Victoria's Secret in a positive way, and with well above average levels of engagement, when the brand is perceived to be more inclusive,\" they said.   Victoria's Secret has come under scrutiny in recent months and increasingly been accused of losing relevance among shoppers as its hypersexualized ads and racy runway shows have failed to resonate in the era of #MeToo.   This came to a head in November after a Vogue interview with Ed Razek, the chief marketing officer of L Brands, went viral online. Razek told the interviewer that he didn't think the company's annual fashion show should feature \"transsexuals\" because the show was a \"fantasy.\"   \"It's a 42-minute entertainment special,\" he said. \"That's what it is.\"   Last month, Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands reported fourth-quarter earnings. Same-store sales at Victoria's Secret were down 3% during the quarter and 3% overall in 2018. L Brands also announced that it would be closing as many as 53 of its stores this year, citing a \"decline in performance\" as the reasoning.   At the same time as Victoria's Secret sales are declining, brands better known for advocating body positivity, such as American Eagle's Aerie and ThirdLove (which is becoming increasingly critical of Victoria's Secret), have gained market share.   Despite this, Victoria's Secret still remains the No.1 lingerie retailer in US and has the power \u2014 via its large store base and massive social media following \u2014 to win back these shoppers.   \"If only they will take it,\" the Bernstein analysts wrote.", "tags": ["market share", "victoria", "sales", "retailer", "post"], "related_articles": [{"title": "Instagrammers loved one Victoria's Secret post that broke the mold \u2014 and it could reveal a comeback strategy for the struggling brand (LB)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-instagram-post-body-inclusive-2019-3"}, {"title": "Former Victoria's Secret executives reveal the likely reason why the company's marketing chief didn't step down after making controversial comments about transgender models, despite widespread backlash (LB)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-why-ed-razek-didnt-resign-execs-say-2019-3"}, {"title": "Dow under pressure | Boeing tanks | Powell: Trump can't fire me", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/11/what-you-need-to-know-in-business-news-monday.html"}]}, {"title": "Dick's Sporting Goods Plunges as Analysts Weigh Turnaround", "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2019-03-12T16:13:21Z", "origContent": "Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. sank by the most in 19 months on Tuesday after the retailer\u2019s  remove hunting gear from some stores.

Oracle calls this product the Autonomous Database, because it automatically applies security patches and \"tunes\" itself to improve performance. The database was first announced in 2017, but a new service that Oracle calls Gen2, which offers the database in Oracle's cloud along with a bunch of special security features, was announced in October.  As part of the company's FY 2019 third-quarter earnings report, Ellison said on Thursday that the database now has nearly 1,000 customers, and is undergoing 4,000 user trials elsewhere.   \"It's early days, but this is the most successful introduction of a new product in Oracle's forty year history,\" Ellison said.   He further explained on the quarterly conference call with analysts that the database is key to Oracle's future.   \"Oracle's future rests on two strategic businesses: cloud applications and cloud infrastructure,\" he said.  Read: How Oracle inadvertently helped Nvidia spend $6.9 billion to win a deal away from Intel  To date, most of Oracle's cloud revenue is based on its cloud applications business, which includes its financial applications (known as enterprise resource management, or ERP) and its HR apps (known in the enterprise app world as as human capital management, or HCM).   But the new database is the lynchpin of the \"cloud infrastructure\" piece, Ellison says, and it is how the company plans to take on cloud mega-giant Amazon Web Services.   Ellison is ready for the fight. Touting better security and faster performance is how Oracle is attempting to woo companies to sign on with its cloud, and not defect to Amazon.   \"Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other,\" he said on the call.   Ellison likes to say that this speed and power will save customers money. AWS executives counter that their databases work better for how customers are actually building their software in the cloud. Indeed, Amazon likes to trash talk Oracle's business model and its treatment of its customers.  On the Thursday analyst call, Ellison discussed one customer, a university that he didn't name, which ditched AWS for Oracle's cloud and database.   This was a university running an app that used machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and cells for cancer. So, its worth noting, that's not a typical way to use a database, compared with, say, storing lists of employee information or sales transactions.   This sunny view of Oracle's important database product was part of Oracle's third quarter earnings, which offered a healthy beat on revenue and earnings versus Wall street estimates.   Oracle reported revenue of $9.61 billion, down by 1% from the year-ago quarter, that beat expectations by $20 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was 87 cents, beating expectations by 3 cents. GAAP EPS was 76 cents.   Oracle no longer breaks out its cloud revenue so it's difficult to see how that all-important business is doing in terms of sales. Management discussed \"double digit\" growth rates, which would be table-stakes growth for a company transforming itself from an old-school software maker to a cloud company.", "tags": ["power", "university", "amazon", "financial applications", "cloud applications"], "related_articles": [{"title": "How Oracle inadvertently helped Nvidia spend $6.9 billion to win a deal away from Intel (INTC, ORCL, NVDA)", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-oracle-inadvertently-helped-nvidia-win-mellanox-away-from-intel-2019-3"}, {"title": "Amazon steps up its open-source game, and Elastic stock falls as a result", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/aws-open-source-move-sends-elastic-stock-down.html"}, {"title": "Cloud company MongoDB soars after crushing earnings", "source": "cnbc", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/13/mongodb-q4-2019-earnings.html"}]}, {"title": "Walmart is launching its own tablet (WMT)", "source": "business-insider", "date": "2019-03-15T14:23:00Z", "origContent": " Walmart intends to introduce a tablet under its private-label brand Onn that sells tech accessories, Bloomberg reports. The tablet will come from a Chinese supplier and use the Android operating system. Its price, release date, and various other details are not yet known.  The addition of the tablet is reportedly part of a \"broader redesign\" of Walmart's electronics section, continuing the retailer's efforts to bolster its offerings in specific product categories.   Walmart has previously revamped its apparel and home sections online to improve its overall e-commerce performance. The retailer partnered with Lord & Taylor to create a section for premium brands on its site, and kicked off its redesign of Walmart.com with its home section, launching its private label MoDRN to build out the selection. By focusing on the products and shopping experiences of specific product categories, Walmart can potentially make parts of its site stand out from those of competitors, like Amazon. This is especially true when it's able to add exclusive brands through partnerships and private labels, as they directly differentiate its offerings.   Adding a tablet isn't Walmart's first step in improving its consumer electronics assortment. Walmart launched Motile\u2014 a private label focused on tech accessories \u2014 in December. While the brand is still in its early days, its introduction, in combination with the planned tablet, suggests that Walmart is targeting the tech category. The retailer has good reason to focus on consumer electronics since Amazon is now the industry leader in the US, giving Walmart the opportunity to compete with its chief e-commerce rival in a market with hundreds of billions of dollars in annual sales.  The strategy of adding private-label consumer electronics, specifically the tablet, may not work as well in the category.The market for tablets is crowded and competitive, with a number of high-profile brands with well-established products. Consumers may not be as interested in buying Walmart's tablets and other devices as they would be in accessories because a device is a bigger investment, and its quality may be of particular concern. To try to help its tablet's performance, Walmart should make it as inexpensive as possible to appeal to its price-conscious consumer base. This would allow the device to stand out and possibly find a niche, which is important as it would likely struggle to compete head to head with products like Apple's iPad.

The case involves high-profile actresses, lawyers, CEOs, vintners, a fashion designer\u00a0and more. What united them was an ability to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to allegedly secure spots for their children at their schools of choice. Documents filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts explain how admissions consultant William (Rick)\u00a0Singer opened a \"side door\" to top universities through the Key Worldwide Foundation. He pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges in the $25-million US scheme. The scam\u00a0involved bribing coaches and university administrators and arranging for falsified test scores on students' entrance exams. At least 33 parents and nine coaches have been charged. Emails, phone conversations and other evidence reveal the lengths parents allegedly went to.\u00a0They included staging photos, faking athleticism and even lying about\u00a0learning disabilities. The allegations within the court documents have not yet been proven in court.\u00a0Here are eight\u00a0of the most intriguing tidbits. 1. Learning disabilities offer an edge A key aspect of the scam was convincing authorities that some of the students needed extra time to write their exams because of learning disabilities. The foundation allegedly worked with a psychologist who helped issue the right documentation. Once that was in place, Singer could get the students' exam sites changed to a high school in Houston, Texas, or a private college in West Hollywood, Calif., where test administrators allegedly took bribes. The result could either be a stand-in who would fly across the country and take the test for the student, or someone to change their answers once they were done, to boost their scores. 2. No athletic ability? No problem Singer worked with some parents to stage photos of their children playing sports everything from soccer to water polo so they could be admitted to the schools as athletes. Prosecutors allege actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, agreed to pay $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California (USC) through its rowing crew in 2016 and 2017. Neither girl was a rower. The couple allegedly sent in photos of both girls practising on an indoor rowing machine to help the cause, according to the court documents. According to the documents, a vintner in Napa Valley got his daughter into USC as a water polo recruit by paying tens of thousands of dollars and having her exam answers changed after she wrote it. The plan also allegedly involved a \"fabricated profile\" of Agustin Huneeus Jr.'s daughter that identified her as a competitive water polo player \u00a0but it wasn't her. Another family allegedly ordered water polo gear through Amazon and worked with a graphic designer to create some natural-looking photos. They went back and forth with the co-operating witness about the images until they looked just right. \"Does this work??\" the family allegedly asked in one email. A co-operating witness replied: \"Yes but a little high out of the water-no one gets that high.'\" The family allegedly paid $250,000; their son was admitted to USC. 4. Father worries about son's water polo practices The foundation assured some parents that their children wouldn't need to worry about actually being athletes; they just had to look like sports buffs. In 2013, Massachusetts-based real estate developer John B. Wilson allegedly worked with the foundation to get his son admitted to USC as a water polo recruit by bribing the team's coach. \"Will the other kids know [my son]\u00a0was a bench warmer side door person?\" Wilson asked in an email to a co-operating witness that's quoted in the court documents. The co-operating witness explained that Wilson's son could abandon the team after his first semester. The school was ultimately provided with falsified \"fabricated swimming times and awards,\" the documents allege. Wilson allegedly kept up a relationship with the co-operating witness to secure \"side door\" university spots for his daughters through competitive sailing. In a wiretapped call in 2018, the co-operating witness encouraged Wilson to wire $500,000, because the slots would go to \"whoever's gonna ante up.\" 5. 'Ruh Ro!' says Huffman, allegedly One 200-page affidavit lays out an FBI agent's findings against families in the case, including actor Felicity Huffman. The document alleges Huffman and her spouse, William H. Macy, made a \"charitable contribution\" of $15,000\u00a0so someone could change their daughter's answers on the SAT. But a counsellor from their daughter's high school offered to monitor the exam. That prompted Huffman to allegedly send an email to someone involved in the scam quoting Scooby-Doo: \"Ruh ro! Looks like [my daughter's high school] wants to provide own proctor.\" The foundation and Huffman allegedly came up with a plan for Huffman's daughter to take the test on a weekend, purportedly so she would not miss school. Huffman's daughter subsequently received an SAT score of 1420. Huffman is charged with felony conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Macy has not been charged. 6. Don't make him look too smart The indictment involving David Sidoo, a businessman and philanthropist in Vancouver, alleges he paid $100,000 for someone to take his son's SAT in 2011. He is also accused of paying the same fee\u00a0for his other son. For his eldest, the plan allegedly involved Sidoo mailing copies of his son's driver's licence and student ID to create a false ID for the test-taker. The test-taker was warned \"not to obtain too high a score\" so that the results would be believable, the documents say.\u00a0Sidoo's son had previously scored 1460 out of 2400. The test-taker got 1670. Sidoo's son was subsequently admitted to Chapman, a private university in California, according to the documents. Sidoo was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud in U.S. federal court earlier this month. A statement released by his lawyer earlier this week emphasized the charge is merely an allegation and \"carries with it the presumption that he is innocent.\" 7. A different sort of Facebook share Not all compensation for the foundation's services came in cash. Davina and Bruce Isackson, a real-estate developer from Hillsborough, Calif., allegedly worked with the Key Worldwide Foundation to have their daughter admitted to UCLA as a soccer player in 2016. The couple also asked the foundation for assurances their monetary \"gift\" would be returned if their daughter didn't get into the school as planned. Once she was admitted, Bruce Isackson allegedly transferred Facebook shares equivalent to about $250,000. Email exchanges and transcripts of\u00a0wiretapped conversations included in the court documents show that some of the students were kept in the dark about their parents' alleged help. Marci Palatella, a liquor distribution CEO who lived in\u00a0\u00a0Hillsborough, Calif., asked for help getting her son into USC in 2016. She took him to the recommended psychologist, and her son wrote his exams at one of the foundation's preferred facilities. Palatella allegedly paid the foundation $75,000.\u00a0 \"Money, for the right environment, Yes,\" Palatella allegedly wrote back. \"But he can never know.\"", "tags": ["witness", "entrance exams", "water polo", "honest services mail fraud", "girl"], "related_articles": [{"title": "How wealthy Americans \u2018get their kids into school\u2019", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8c239408-451f-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb"}, {"title": "Who is William Rick Singer, the college admissions cheating scandal's alleged ringleader? - Fox News", "source": "fox-news", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-is-william-rick-singer-college-admissions-cheating-scandals-alleged-ringleader"}, {"title": "Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin among several dozen snared in elite college cheating scheme, authorities say - Fox News", "source": "fox-news", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-among-several-dozen-snared-in-elite-college-cheating-scheme-authorities-say"}]}]}
